 - `Topic` must be one of `build|ci|docs|feat|fix|perf|refactor|chore|test`

 Sample Titles:
 - `feat(Enterprise)`: Backups can now get credentials from IAM
 - `fix(Query)`: Skipping floats that cannot be Marshalled in JSON
 - `perf: [Breaking]` json encoding is now 35% faster if SIMD is present
 - `chore`: all chores/tests will be excluded from the CHANGELOG
