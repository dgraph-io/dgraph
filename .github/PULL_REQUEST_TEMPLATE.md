**Description**

Please explain the changes you made here.

**Checklist**

- [ ] The PR title follows the
      [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) syntax, leading
      with `fix:`, `feat:`, `chore:`, `ci:`, etc.
- [ ] Code compiles correctly and linting (via trunk) passes locally
- [ ] Tests added for new functionality, or regression tests for bug fixes added as applicable
- [ ] For public APIs, new features, etc., a PR on the
      [docs repo](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph-docs) staged and linked here. This process can
      be simplified by going to the [public docs site](https://docs.dgraph.io/) and clicking the
      "Edit this page" button at the bottom of page(s) relevant to your changes. Ensure that you
      indicate in the PR that this is an **unreleased** feature so that it does not get merged into
      the main docs prematurely.

**Instructions**

- The PR title should follow the
  [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) syntax, leading
  with `fix:`, `feat:`, `chore:`, `ci:`, etc. Ensure any breaking changes are appropriately marked
  with a `!`. For instance, `feat(dql)!: Remove the foobar func` would indicate that this is a
  breaking change to the DQL syntax.
- The description should briefly explain what the PR is about. In the case of a bugfix, describe or
  link to the bug.
- In the checklist section, check the boxes in that are applicable, using `[x]` syntax.
  - If not applicable, remove the entire line. Only leave the box unchecked if you intend to come
    back and check the box later.
- Delete the `Instructions` line and everything below it, to indicate you have read and are
  following these instructions. 🙂

Thank you for your contribution to Dgraph!
