# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project will adhere to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) starting v1.0.0.

## [1.0.13] - 2019-03-10
[1.0.13]: https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/compare/v1.0.12...v1.0.13

**Note: This release supersedes v1.0.12 with bug fixes. If you're running v1.0.12, please upgrade to v1.0.13. It is safe to upgrade in-place without a data export and import.**

### Fixed

- Fix Raft panic. ([8cb69ea](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/commit/8cb69ea))
- Log an error instead of an assertion check for SrcUIDs being nil. ([691b3b3](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/commit/691b3b3))

## [1.0.12] - 2019-03-05
[1.0.12]: https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/compare/v1.0.11...v1.0.12

**Note: This release requires you to export and re-import data prior to
upgrading or rolling back. The underlying data format has been changed.**

### Added

- Support gzip compression for gRPC and HTTP requests.
  ([#2843](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2843))
- Restore is available from a full binary backup. This is an enterprise
  feature licensed under the Dgraph Community License.
- Strict schema mode via `--mutations` flag. By default `--mutations=allow` is
  set to allow all mutations; `--mutations=disallow` disables all mutations;
  `--mutations=strict` allows mutations only for predicates which are defined in
  the schema. Fixes [#2277](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2277).
- Add `dgraph increment` tool for debugging and testing. The increment tool
  queries for the specified predicate (default: `counter.val`), increments its
  integer counter value, and mutates the result back to Dgraph. Useful for
  testing end-to-end txns to verify cluster health.
  ([#2955](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2955))
- Support best-effort queries. This would relax the requirement of linearizible
  reads. For best-effort queries, Alpha would request timestamps from memory
  instead of making an outbound request to Zero.
  ([#3071](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/3071))

### Changed

- Use the new Stream API from Badger instead of Dgraph's Stream framework. ([#2852](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2852))
- Discard earlier versions of posting lists. ([#2859](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2859))
- Make HTTP JSON response encoding more efficient by operating on a bytes buffer
  directly. ([ae1d9f3](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/commit/ae1d9f3))
- Optimize and refactor facet filtering. ([#2829](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2829))
- Show badger.Item meta information in `dgraph debug` output.
- Add new option to `dgraph debug` tool to get a histogram of key and value sizes. ([#2844](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2844))
- Add new option to `dgraph debug` tool to get info from a particular read timestamp.
- Refactor rebuild index logic. ([#2851](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2851), [#2866](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2866))
- For gRPC clients, schema queries are returned in the Json field. The Schema proto field is deprecated.
- Simplify design and make tablet moves robust. ([#2800](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2800))
- Switch all node IDs to hex in logs (e.g., ID 0xa instead of ID 10), so they are consistent with Raft logs.
- Refactor reindexing code to only reindex specific tokenizers. ([#2948](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2948))
- Introduce group checksums. ([#2964](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2964), [#3085](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/3085))
- Return aborted error if commit ts is 0.
- Reduce number of "ClusterInfoOnly" requests to Zero by making VerifyUid wait for membership information. ([#2974](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2974))
- Simplify Raft WAL storage caching. ([#3102](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/3102))
- Build release binary with Go version 1.11.5.

### Removed

- **Remove LRU cache from Alpha for big wins in query latency reduction (5-10x)
  and mutation throughput (live loading 1.7x faster).** Setting `--lru_mb` is
  still required but will not have any effect since the cache is removed. The
  flag will be used later version when LRU cache is introduced within Badger and
  configurable from Dgraph.
- Remove `--nomutations` flag. Its functionality has moved into strict schema
  mode with the `--mutations` flag (see Added section).

### Fixed

- Use json.Marshal for strings and blobs. Fixes [#2662](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2662).
- Let eq use string "uid" as value. Fixes [#2827](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2827).
- Skip empty posting lists in `has` function.
- Fix Rollup to pick max update commit ts.
- Fix a race condition when processing concurrent queries. Fixes [#2849](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2849).
- Show an error when running multiple mutation blocks. Fixes [#2815](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2815).
- Bring in optimizations and bug fixes over from Badger.
- Bulk Loader for multi-group (sharded data) clusters writes out per-group
  schema with only the predicates owned by the group instead of all predicates
  in the cluster. This fixes an issue where queries made to one group may not
  return data served by other groups.
  ([#3065](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/3065))
- Remove the assert failure in raftwal/storage.go.

## [1.0.10] - 2018-11-05
[1.0.10]: https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/compare/v1.0.9...v1.0.10

**Note: This release requires you to export and re-import data. We have changed the underlying storage format.**

### Added

- The Alter endpoint can be protected by an auth token that is set on the Dgraph Alphas via the `--auth_token` option. This can help prevent accidental schema updates and drop all operations. ([#2692](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2692))
- Optimize has function ([#2724](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2724))
- Expose the health check API via gRPC. ([#2721](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2721))

### Changed

- Dgraph is relicensed to Apache 2.0. ([#2652](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2652))
- **Breaking change**. Rename Dgraph Server to Dgraph Alpha to clarify discussions of the Dgraph cluster. The top-level command `dgraph server` is now `dgraph alpha`. ([#2667](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2667))
- Prometheus metrics have been renamed for consistency for alpha, memory, and lru cache metrics. ([#2636](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2636), [#2670](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2670), [#2714](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2714))
- The `dgraph-converter` command is available as the subcommand `dgraph conv`. ([#2635](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2635))

- Better control excessive traffic to Dgraph ([#2678](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2678))
- Export format now exports on the Alpha receiving the export request. The naming scheme of the export files has been simplified.
- Improvements to the `dgraph debug` tool that can be used to inspect the contents of the posting lists directory.
- Bring in Badger updates ([#2697](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2697))

### Fixed

- Make raft leader resume probing after snapshot crash ([#2707](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2707))
- **Breaking change:** Create a lot simpler sorted uint64 codec ([#2716](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2716))
- Increase the size of applyCh, to give Raft some breathing space. Otherwise, it fails to maintain quorum health.
- Zero should stream last commit update
- Send commit timestamps in order ([#2687](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2687))
- Query blocks with the same name are no longer allowed.
- Fix out-of-range values in query parser. ([#2690](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2690))

## [1.0.9] - 2018-10-02
[1.0.9]: https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/compare/v1.0.8...v1.0.9

### Added

- This version switches Badger Options to reasonable settings for p and w directories. This removes the need to expose `--badger.options` option and removes the `none` option from `--badger.vlog`. ([#2605](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2605))
- Add support for ignoring parse errors in bulk loader with the option `--ignore_error`. ([#2599](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2599))
- Introduction of new command `dgraph cert` to simplify initial TLS setup. See [TLS configuration docs](https://docs.dgraph.io/deploy/#tls-configuration) for more info.
- Add `expand(_forward_)` and `expand(_reverse_)` to GraphQL+- query language. If `_forward_` is passed as an argument to `expand()`, all predicates at that level (minus any reverse predicates) are retrieved.
If `_reverse_` is passed as an argument to `expand()`, only the reverse predicates are retrieved.

### Changed

- Rename intern pkg to pb ([#2608](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2608))

### Fixed

- Remove LinRead map logic from Dgraph ([#2570](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2570))
- Sanity length check for facets mostly.
- Make has function correct w.r.t. transactions ([#2585](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2585))
- Increase the snapshot calculation interval, while decreasing the min number of entries required; so we take snapshots even when there's little activity.
- Convert an assert during DropAll to inf retry. ([#2578](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2578))
- Fix a bug which caused all transactions to abort if `--expand_edge` was set to false. Fixes [#2547](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2547).
- Set the Applied index in Raft directly, so it does not pick up an index older than the snapshot. Ensure that it is in sync with the Applied watermark. Fixes [#2581](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2581).
- Pull in Badger updates. This also fixes the Unable to find log file, retry error.
- Improve efficiency of readonly transactions by reusing the same read ts ([#2604](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2604))
- Fix a bug in Raft.Run loop. ([#2606](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2606))
- Fix a few issues regarding snapshot.Index for raft.Cfg.Applied. Do not overwrite any existing data when apply txn commits. Do not let CreateSnapshot fail.
- Consider all future versions of the key as well, when deciding whether to write a key or not during txn commits. Otherwise, we'll end up in an endless loop of trying to write a stale key but failing to do so.
- When testing inequality value vars with non-matching values, the response was sent as an error although it should return empty result if the query has correct syntax. ([#2611](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2611))
- Switch traces to glogs in worker/export.go ([#2614](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2614))
- Improve error handling for `dgraph live` for errors when processing RDF and schema files. ([#2596](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2596))
- Fix task conversion from bool to int that used uint32 ([#2621](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2621))
- Fix `expand(_all_)` in recurse queries ([#2600](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2600)).
- Add language aliases for broader support for full text indices. ([#2602](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2602))

## [1.0.8] - 2018-08-29
[1.0.8]: https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/compare/v1.0.7...v1.0.8

### Added

- Introduce a new /assignIds HTTP endpoint in Zero, so users can allocate UIDs to nodes externally.
- Add a new tool which retrieves and increments a counter by 1 transactionally. This can be used to test the sanity of Dgraph cluster.

### Changed

- This version introduces tracking of a few anonymous metrics to measure Dgraph adoption ([#2554](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2554)). These metrics do not contain any specifically identifying information about the user, so most users can leave it on. This can be turned off by setting `--telemetry=false` flag if needed in Dgraph Zero.

### Fixed

- Correctly handle a list of type geo in json ([#2482](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2482), [#2485](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2485)).
- Fix the graceful shutdown of Dgraph server, so a single Ctrl+C would now suffice to stop it.
- Fix various deadlocks in Dgraph and set ConfState in Raft correctly ([#2548](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2548)).
- Significantly decrease the number of transaction aborts by using SPO as key for entity to entity connections. ([#2556](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2556)).
- Do not print error while sending Raft message by default. No action needs to be taken by the user, so it is set to V(3) level.

## [1.0.7] - 2018-08-10
[1.0.7]: https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/compare/v1.0.6...v1.0.7

### Changed

- Set the `--conc` flag in live loader default to 1, as a temporary fix to avoid tons of aborts.

### Fixed

- All Oracle delta streams are applied via Raft proposals. This deals better with network partition like edge-cases. [#2463](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2463)
- Fix deadlock in 10-node cluster convergence. Fixes [#2286](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2286).
- Make ReadIndex work safely. [#2469](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2469)
- Simplify snapshots, leader now calculates and proposes snapshots to the group. [#2475](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2475).
- Make snapshot streaming more robust. [#2487](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2487)
- Consolidate all txn tracking logic into Oracle, remove inSnapshot logic. [#2480](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2480).
- Bug fix in Badger, to stop panics when exporting.
- Use PreVote to avoid leader change on a node join.
- Fix a long-standing bug where `raft.Step` was being called via goroutines. It is now called serially.
- Fix context deadline issues with proposals. [#2501](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/2501).

### Changed

* Transaction HTTP API has been modified slightly. `start_ts` is now a path parameter instead of a header.
For `/commit` API, keys are passed in the body.

## [0.9.0] - 2017-11-14
[0.9.0]: https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/compare/v0.8.3...v0.9.0

**The latest release has a lot of breaking changes but also brings powerful features like Transactions, support for CJK and custom tokenization.**

### Added

* Dgraph adds support for distributed ACID transactions (a blog post is in works). Transactions can be done via the Go, Java or HTTP clients (JS client coming). See [docs here](https://docs.dgraph.io/clients/).
* Support for Indexing via [Custom tokenizers](https://docs.dgraph.io/query-language/#indexing-with-custom-tokenizers).
* Support for CJK languages in the full-text index.

### Changed

#### Running Dgraph

* We have consolidated all the `server`, `zero`, `live/bulk-loader` binaries into a single `dgraph` binary for convenience. Instructions for running Dgraph can be found in the [docs](https://docs.dgraph.io/get-started/).
* For Dgraph server, Raft ids can be assigned automatically. A user can optionally still specify an ID, via `--idx` flag.
* `--peer` flag which was used to specify another Zero instance’s IP address is being replaced by `--zero` flag to indicate the address corresponds to Dgraph zero.
* `port`, `grpc_port` and `worker_port` flags have been removed from Dgraph server and Zero. The ports are:

- Internal Grpc: 7080
- HTTP: 8080
- External Grpc: 9080 (Dgraph server only)

Users can set `port_offset` flag, to modify these fixed ports.

#### Queries

* Queries, mutations and schema updates are done through separate endpoints. **Queries can no longer have a mutation block.**
* Queries can be done via `Query` Grpc endpoint (it was called `Run` before) or the `/query` HTTP handler.
* `_uid_` is renamed to `uid`. So queries now need to request for `uid`. Example
```
{
  bladerunner(func: eq(name@en, "Blade Runner")) {
    uid
    name@en
  }
}
```
* Facets response structure has been modified and is a lot flatter. Facet key is now `predicate|facet_name`.
Examples for [Go client](https://godoc.org/github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/client#example-Txn-Mutate-Facets) and [HTTP](https://docs.dgraph.io/query-language/#facets-edge-attributes).
* Query latency is now returned as numeric (ns) instead of string.
* [`Recurse`](https://docs.dgraph.io/query-language/#recurse-query) is now a directive. So queries with `recurse` keyword at root won't work anymore.
* Syntax for [`count` at root](https://docs.dgraph.io/query-language/#count) has changed. You need to ask for `count(uid)`, instead of `count()`.

#### Mutations

* Mutations can only be done via `Mutate` Grpc endpoint or via [`/mutate` HTTP handler](https://docs.dgraph.io/clients/#transactions).
* `Mutate` Grpc endpoint can be used to set/ delete JSON, or set/ delete a list of N-Quads and set/ delete raw RDF strings.
* Mutation blocks don't require the mutation keyword anymore. Here is an example of the new syntax.
```
{
  set {
    <name> <is> <something> .
    <hometown> <is> "San Francisco" .
  }
}
```
* [`Upsert`](https://docs.dgraph.io/v0.8.3/query-language/#upsert) directive and [mutation variables](https://docs.dgraph.io/v0.8.3/query-language/#variables-in-mutations) go away. Both these functionalities can now easily be achieved via transactions.

#### Schema

* `<*> <pred> <*>` operations, that is deleting a predicate can't be done via mutations anymore. They need to be done via `Alter` Grpc endpoint or via the `/alter` HTTP handler.
* Drop all is now done via `Alter`.
* Schema updates are now done via `Alter` Grpc endpoint or via `/alter` HTTP handler.

#### Go client

* `Query` Grpc endpoint returns response in JSON under `Json` field instead of protocol buffer. `client.Unmarshal` method also goes away from the Go client. Users can use `json.Unmarshal` for unmarshalling the response.
* Response for predicate of type `geo` can be unmarshalled into a struct. Example [here](https://godoc.org/github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/client#example-package--SetObject).
* `Node` and `Edge` structs go away along with the `SetValue...` methods. We recommend using [`SetJson`](https://godoc.org/github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/client#example-package--SetObject) and `DeleteJson` fields to do mutations.
* Examples of how to use transactions using the client can be found at https://docs.dgraph.io/clients/#go.

### Removed
- Embedded dgraph goes away. We haven’t seen much usage of this feature. And it adds unnecessary maintenance overhead to the code.
- Dgraph live no longer stores external ids. And hence the `xid` flag is gone.
