# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project will adhere to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) starting v1.0.0.

## 1.0.12 - [Unreleased]
[Unreleased]: https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/compare/v1.0.11...release/v1.0

### Added

- Support gzip compression for gRPC and HTTP requests. (#2843)

### Changed

- Use the new Stream API from Badger instead of Dgraph's Stream framework. (#2852)
- Discard earlier versions of posting lists. (#2859)
- Make HTTP JSON response encoding more efficient.
- Optimize and refactor facet filtering. (#2829)
- Show badger.Item meta information in `dgraph debug` output.
- Add new option to `dgraph debug` tool to get a histogram of key and value sizes. (#2844)
- Add new option to `dgraph debug` tool to get info from a particular read timestamp.

### Removed

- Remove LRU cache from Alpha for big wins in query latency reduction (5-10x)
  and mutation throughput (live loading 1.7x faster). Setting `--lru_mb`,
  although still required, will not have any effect since the cache is removed.
  The flag will be used later when LRU cache is introduced in Badger.

### Fixed

- Use json.Marshal for strings and blobs. Fixes #2662.
- Let eq use string "uid" as value. Fixes #2827.
- Skip empty posting lists in `has` function.
- Fix Rollup to pick max update commit ts.
- Fix a race condition when processing concurrent queries. Fixes #2849.

## [1.0.10] - 2018-11-05
[1.0.10]: https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/compare/v1.0.9...v1.0.10

**Note: This release requires you to export and re-import data. We have changed the underlying storage format.**

### Added

- The Alter endpoint can be protected by an auth token that is set on the Dgraph Alphas via the `--auth_token` option. This can help prevent accidental schema updates and drop all operations. (#2692)
- Optimize has function (#2724)
- Expose the health check API via gRPC. (#2721)

### Changed

- Dgraph is relicensed to Apache 2.0. (#2652)
- **Breaking change**. Rename Dgraph Server to Dgraph Alpha to clarify discussions of the Dgraph cluster. The top-level command `dgraph server` is now `dgraph alpha`. (#2667)
- Prometheus metrics have been renamed for consistency for alpha, memory, and lru cache metrics. (#2636, #2670, #2714)
- The `dgraph-converter` command is available as the subcommand `dgraph conv`. (#2635)
- Updating protobuf version. (#2639)
- Allow checkpwd to be aliased (#2641)
- Better control excessive traffic to Dgraph (#2678)
- Export format now exports on the Alpha receiving the export request. The naming scheme of the export files has been simplified.
- Improvements to the `dgraph debug` tool that can be used to inspect the contents of the posting lists directory.
- Bring in Badger updates (#2697)

### Fixed

- Make raft leader resume probing after snapshot crash (#2707)
- **Breaking change:** Create a lot simpler sorted uint64 codec (#2716)
- Increase the size of applyCh, to give Raft some breathing space. Otherwise, it fails to maintain quorum health.
- Zero should stream last commit update
- Send commit timestamps in order (#2687)
- Query blocks with the same name are no longer allowed.
- Fix out-of-range values in query parser. (#2690)

## [1.0.9] - 2018-10-02
[1.0.9]: https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/compare/v1.0.8...v1.0.9

### Added

- This version switches Badger Options to reasonable settings for p and w directories. This removes the need to expose `--badger.options` option and removes the `none` option from `--badger.vlog`. (#2605)
- Add support for ignoring parse errors in bulk loader with the option `--ignore_error`. (#2599)
- Introduction of new command `dgraph cert` to simplify initial TLS setup. See [TLS configuration docs](https://docs.dgraph.io/deploy/#tls-configuration) for more info.
- Add `expand(_forward_)` and `expand(_reverse_)` to GraphQL+- query language. If `_forward_` is passed as an argument to `expand()`, all predicates at that level (minus any reverse predicates) are retrieved.
If `_reverse_` is passed as an argument to `expand()`, only the reverse predicates are retrieved.

### Changed

- Rename intern pkg to pb (#2608)

### Fixed

- Remove LinRead map logic from Dgraph (#2570)
- Sanity length check for facets mostly.
- Make has function correct w.r.t. transactions (#2585)
- Increase the snapshot calculation interval, while decreasing the min number of entries required; so we take snapshots even when there's little activity.
- Convert an assert during DropAll to inf retry. (#2578)
- Fix a bug which caused all transactions to abort if `--expand_edge` was set to false. Fixes #2547.
- Set the Applied index in Raft directly, so it does not pick up an index older than the snapshot. Ensure that it is in sync with the Applied watermark. Fixes #2581.
- Pull in Badger updates. This also fixes the Unable to find log file, retry error.
- Improve efficiency of readonly transactions by reusing the same read ts (#2604)
- Fix a bug in Raft.Run loop. (#2606)
- Fix a few issues regarding snapshot.Index for raft.Cfg.Applied. Do not overwrite any existing data when apply txn commits. Do not let CreateSnapshot fail.
- Consider all future versions of the key as well, when deciding whether to write a key or not during txn commits. Otherwise, we'll end up in an endless loop of trying to write a stale key but failing to do so.
- When testing inequality value vars with non-matching values, the response was sent as an error although it should return empty result if the query has correct syntax. (#2611)
- Switch traces to glogs in worker/export.go (#2614)
- Improve error handling for `dgraph live` for errors when processing RDF and schema files. (#2596)
- Fix task conversion from bool to int that used uint32 (#2621)
- Fix `expand(_all_)` in recurse queries (#2600).
- Add language aliases for broader support for full text indices. (#2602)

## [1.0.8] - 2018-08-29
[1.0.8]: https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/compare/v1.0.7...v1.0.8

### Added

- Introduce a new /assignIds HTTP endpoint in Zero, so users can allocate UIDs to nodes externally.
- Add a new tool which retrieves and increments a counter by 1 transactionally. This can be used to test the sanity of Dgraph cluster.

### Changed

- This version introduces tracking of a few anonymous metrics to measure Dgraph adoption (#2554). These metrics do not contain any specifically identifying information about the user, so most users can leave it on. This can be turned off by setting `--telemetry=false` flag if needed in Dgraph Zero.

### Fixed

- Correctly handle a list of type geo in json (#2482, #2485).
- Fix the graceful shutdown of Dgraph server, so a single Ctrl+C would now suffice to stop it.
- Fix various deadlocks in Dgraph and set ConfState in Raft correctly (#2548).
- Significantly decrease the number of transaction aborts by using SPO as key for entity to entity connections. (#2556).
- Do not print error while sending Raft message by default. No action needs to be taken by the user, so it is set to V(3) level.

## [1.0.7] - 2018-08-10
[1.0.7]: https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/compare/v1.0.6...v1.0.7

### Changed

- Set the `--conc` flag in live loader default to 1, as a temporary fix to avoid tons of aborts.

### Fixed

- All Oracle delta streams are applied via Raft proposals. This deals better with network partition like edge-cases. #2463
- Fix deadlock in 10-node cluster convergence. Fixes #2286.
- Make ReadIndex work safely. #2469
- Simplify snapshots, leader now calculates and proposes snapshots to the group. #2475.
- Make snapshot streaming more robust. #2487
- Consolidate all txn tracking logic into Oracle, remove inSnapshot logic. #2480.
- Bug fix in Badger, to stop panics when exporting.
- Use PreVote to avoid leader change on a node join.
- Fix a long-standing bug where `raft.Step` was being called via goroutines. It is now called serially.
- Fix context deadline issues with proposals. #2501.

## [0.9.1] - 2017-11-15
[0.9.1]: https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/compare/v0.9.0...v0.9.1

### Changed

* Transaction HTTP API has been modified slightly. `start_ts` is now a path parameter instead of a header.
For `/commit` API, keys are passed in the body.

## [0.9.0] - 2017-11-14
[0.9.0]: https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/compare/v0.8.3...v0.9.0

**The latest release has a lot of breaking changes but also brings powerful features like Transactions, support for CJK and custom tokenization.**

### Added

* Dgraph adds support for distributed ACID transactions (a blog post is in works). Transactions can be done via the Go, Java or HTTP clients (JS client coming). See [docs here](https://docs.dgraph.io/clients/).
* Support for Indexing via [Custom tokenizers](https://docs.dgraph.io/query-language/#indexing-with-custom-tokenizers).
* Support for CJK languages in the full-text index.

### Changed

#### Running Dgraph

* We have consolidated all the `server`, `zero`, `live/bulk-loader` binaries into a single `dgraph` binary for convenience. Instructions for running Dgraph can be found in the [docs](https://docs.dgraph.io/get-started/).
* For Dgraph server, Raft ids can be assigned automatically. A user can optionally still specify an ID, via `--idx` flag.
* `--peer` flag which was used to specify another Zero instance’s IP address is being replaced by `--zero` flag to indicate the address corresponds to Dgraph zero.
* `port`, `grpc_port` and `worker_port` flags have been removed from Dgraph server and Zero. The ports are:

- Internal Grpc: 7080
- HTTP: 8080
- External Grpc: 9080 (Dgraph server only)

Users can set `port_offset` flag, to modify these fixed ports.

#### Queries

* Queries, mutations and schema updates are done through separate endpoints. **Queries can no longer have a mutation block.**
* Queries can be done via `Query` Grpc endpoint (it was called `Run` before) or the `/query` HTTP handler.
* `_uid_` is renamed to `uid`. So queries now need to request for `uid`. Example
```
{
  bladerunner(func: eq(name@en, "Blade Runner")) {
    uid
    name@en
  }
}
```
* Facets response structure has been modified and is a lot flatter. Facet key is now `predicate|facet_name`.
Examples for [Go client](https://godoc.org/github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/client#example-Txn-Mutate-Facets) and [HTTP](https://docs.dgraph.io/query-language/#facets-edge-attributes).
* Query latency is now returned as numeric (ns) instead of string.
* [`Recurse`](https://docs.dgraph.io/query-language/#recurse-query) is now a directive. So queries with `recurse` keyword at root won't work anymore.
* Syntax for [`count` at root](https://docs.dgraph.io/query-language/#count) has changed. You need to ask for `count(uid)`, instead of `count()`.

#### Mutations

* Mutations can only be done via `Mutate` Grpc endpoint or via [`/mutate` HTTP handler](https://docs.dgraph.io/clients/#transactions).
* `Mutate` Grpc endpoint can be used to set/ delete JSON, or set/ delete a list of NQuads and set/ delete raw RDF strings.
* Mutation blocks don't require the mutation keyword anymore. Here is an example of the new syntax.
```
{
  set {
    <name> <is> <something> .
    <hometown> <is> "San Francisco" .
  }
}
```
* [`Upsert`](https://docs.dgraph.io/v0.8.3/query-language/#upsert) directive and [mutation variables](https://docs.dgraph.io/v0.8.3/query-language/#variables-in-mutations) go away. Both these functionalities can now easily be achieved via transactions.

#### Schema

* `<*> <pred> <*>` operations, that is deleting a predicate can't be done via mutations anymore. They need to be done via `Alter` Grpc endpoint or via the `/alter` HTTP handler.
* Drop all is now done via `Alter`.
* Schema updates are now done via `Alter` Grpc endpoint or via `/alter` HTTP handler.

#### Go client

* `Query` Grpc endpoint returns response in JSON under `Json` field instead of protocol buffer. `client.Unmarshal` method also goes away from the Go client. Users can use `json.Unmarshal` for unmarshalling the response.
* Response for predicate of type `geo` can be unmarshalled into a struct. Example [here](https://godoc.org/github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/client#example-package--SetObject).
* `Node` and `Edge` structs go away along with the `SetValue...` methods. We recommend using [`SetJson`](https://godoc.org/github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/client#example-package--SetObject) and `DeleteJson` fields to do mutations.
* Examples of how to use transactions using the client can be found at https://docs.dgraph.io/clients/#go.

### Removed
- Embedded dgraph goes away. We haven’t seen much usage of this feature. And it adds unnecessary maintenance overhead to the code.
- Dgraph live no longer stores external ids. And hence the `xid` flag is gone.
