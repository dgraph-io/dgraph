# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project will adhere to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) starting v1.0.0.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

* Allow doing Mutate and Alter Operations using dgraph UI.
* Provide option to user to ignore conflicts on index keys.

### Fixed

* Language tag parsing in queries now accepts digits (in line with RDF parsing).
* Ensure that GraphQL variables are declared before use.
* Export now uses correct blank node syntax.
* Membership stream doesn't get stuck if node steps down as leader.
* Fix issue where sets were not being returned after doing a S P * deletion when part of same
  transaction.
* Empty string values are stored as it is and no strings have special meaning now.
* Correctly update order of facetMatrix when orderdesc/orderasc is applied.
* Allow live and bulk loaders to work with multiple zeros.
* Fix sorting with for predicates with multiple language tags.
* Fix alias edge cases in normalize directive.
* Allow reading new index key mutated as part of same transaction.
* Fix bug in value log GC in badger.
* SIGINT now forces a shutdown after 5 seconds when there are pending RPCs.

### Changed

* `DropAttr` now also removes the schema for the attribute (previously it just removed the edges).
*  Tablet metadata is removed from zero after deletion of predicate.
*  LRU size is changed dynamically now based on `max_memory_mb`
*  Call RunValueLogGC for every GB increase in size of value logs. Upgrade vendored version of
   Badger.
*  Prohibit string to password schema change.
*  Make purging less aggresive.
*  Check if GraphQL Variable is defined before using.

## [0.9.3] - 2017-12-01

### Added

* Support for alias while asking for facets.
* Support for general configuration via environment variables and configuration files.
* `IgnoreIndexConflict` field in Txn which allows ignoring conflicts on index keys.

### Fixed

* `expand(_all_)` now correctly gives all language variants of a string.
* Indexes now correctly maintained when deleting via `S * *` and `S P *`.
* `expand(_all_)` now follows reverse edges.
* Don't return uid for nodes without any children when requested through debug flag.
* GraphQL variables for HTTP endpoints. Variable map can be set as a JSON
  object using the `X-Dgraph-Vars` header.
* Abort if CommitNow flag is set and the mutation fails.
* Live loader treats subjects/predicates that look like UIDs as existing nodes
  rather than new nodes.
* Fix bug in `@groupby` queries where predicate was converted to lower case in queries.

### Changed

* When showing a predicate with list type, only values without a language tag are shown. To get the values of the predicate that are tagged with a language, query the predicate with that language explicitly.
* Validate the address advertised by dgraph nodes.
* Store/Restore peer map on snapshot.
* Fix rdfs per second reporting in live loader.
* Fix bug in lru eviction.
* Proto definitions are split into intern and api.

## [0.9.2] - 2017-11-20

### Added

* Support for removing dead node from quorum.
* Support for alias in groupby queries.
* Add DeleteEdges helper function for Go client.

### Changed

* Dgraph tries to abort long running/abandoned transactions.
* Fix TLS flag parsing for Dgraph server and live loader.
* Reduce dependencies for Go client.
* `depth` and `loop` arguments should be inside @recurse().
* Base36 encode keys that are part of TxnContext and are sent to the client.
* Fix race condition in expand(_all_) queries.
* Fix (--ui) flag not being parsed properly.

## [0.9.1] - 2017-11-15

### Changed

* Transaction HTTP API has been modified slightly. `start_ts` is now a path parameter instead of a header.
For `/commit` API, keys are passed in the body.

## [0.9.0] - 2017-11-14

**The latest release has a lot of breaking changes but also brings powerful features like Transactions, support for CJK and custom tokenization.**

### Added

* Dgraph adds support for distributed ACID transactions (a blog post is in works). Transactions can be done via the Go, Java or HTTP clients (JS client coming). See [docs here](https://docs.dgraph.io/clients/).
* Support for Indexing via [Custom tokenizers](https://docs.dgraph.io/query-language/#indexing-with-custom-tokenizers).
* Support for CJK languages in the full-text index.

### Changed

#### Running Dgraph

* We have consolidated all the `server`, `zero`, `live/bulk-loader` binaries into a single `dgraph` binary for convenience. Instructions for running Dgraph can be found in the [docs](https://docs.dgraph.io/get-started/).
* For Dgraph server, Raft ids can be assigned automatically. A user can optionally still specify an ID, via `--idx` flag.
* `--peer` flag which was used to specify another Zero instance’s IP address is being replaced by `--zero` flag to indicate the address corresponds to Dgraph zero.
* `port`, `grpc_port` and `worker_port` flags have been removed from Dgraph server and Zero. The ports are:

- Internal Grpc: 7080
- HTTP: 8080
- External Grpc: 9080 (Dgraph server only)

Users can set `port_offset` flag, to modify these fixed ports.

#### Queries

* Queries, mutations and schema updates are done through separate endpoints. **Queries can no longer have a mutation block.**
* Queries can be done via `Query` Grpc endpoint (it was called `Run` before) or the `/query` HTTP handler.
* `_uid_` is renamed to `uid`. So queries now need to request for `uid`. Example
```
{
  bladerunner(func: eq(name@en, "Blade Runner")) {
    uid
    name@en
  }
}
```
* Facets response structure has been modified and is a lot flatter. Facet key is now `predicate|facet_name`.
Examples for [Go client](https://godoc.org/github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/client#example-Txn-Mutate-Facets) and [HTTP](https://docs.dgraph.io/query-language/#facets-edge-attributes).
* Query latency is now returned as numeric (ns) instead of string. 
* [`Recurse`](https://docs.dgraph.io/query-language/#recurse-query) is now a directive. So queries with `recurse` keyword at root won't work anymore.
* Syntax for [`count` at root](https://docs.dgraph.io/query-language/#count) has changed. You need to ask for `count(uid)`, instead of `count()`.

#### Mutations

* Mutations can only be done via `Mutate` Grpc endpoint or via [`/mutate` HTTP handler](https://docs.dgraph.io/clients/#transactions). 
* `Mutate` Grpc endpoint can be used to set/ delete JSON, or set/ delete a list of NQuads and set/ delete raw RDF strings.
* Mutation blocks don't require the mutation keyword anymore. Here is an example of the new syntax.
```
{
  set {
    <name> <is> <something> .
    <hometown> <is> "San Francisco" .
  }
}
```
* [`Upsert`](https://docs.dgraph.io/v0.8.3/query-language/#upsert) directive and [mutation variables](https://docs.dgraph.io/v0.8.3/query-language/#variables-in-mutations) go away. Both these functionalities can now easily be achieved via transactions.

#### Schema

* `<*> <pred> <*>` operations, that is deleting a predicate can't be done via mutations anymore. They need to be done via `Alter` Grpc endpoint or via the `/alter` HTTP handler.
* Drop all is now done via `Alter`.
* Schema updates are now done via `Alter` Grpc endpoint or via `/alter` HTTP handler.

#### Go client

* `Query` Grpc endpoint returns response in JSON under `Json` field instead of protocol buffer. `client.Unmarshal` method also goes away from the Go client. Users can use `json.Unmarshal` for unmarshalling the response.
* Response for predicate of type `geo` can be unmarshalled into a struct. Example [here](https://godoc.org/github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/client#example-package--SetObject).
* `Node` and `Edge` structs go away along with the `SetValue...` methods. We recommend using [`SetJson`](https://godoc.org/github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/client#example-package--SetObject) and `DeleteJson` fields to do mutations. 
* Examples of how to use transactions using the client can be found at https://docs.dgraph.io/clients/#go. 

### Removed
- Embedded dgraph goes away. We haven’t seen much usage of this feature. And it adds unnecessary maintenance overhead to the code.
- Dgraph live no longer stores external ids. And hence the `xid` flag is gone.
