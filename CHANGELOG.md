# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project will adhere to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) starting v1.0.0.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

* Support for removing dead node from quorum.

### Changed

* Dgraph tries to abort long running/abandoned transactions.

## [0.9.1] - 2017-11-15

### Changed

* Transaction HTTP API has been modified slightly. `start_ts` is now a path parameter instead of a header.
For `/commit` API, keys are passed in the body.

## [0.9.0] - 2017-11-14

**The latest release has a lot of breaking changes but also brings powerful features like Transactions, support for CJK and custom tokenization.**

### Added

* Dgraph adds support for distributed ACID transactions (a blog post is in works). Transactions can be done via the Go, Java or HTTP clients (JS client coming). See [docs here](https://docs.dgraph.io/clients/).
* Support for Indexing via [Custom tokenizers](https://docs.dgraph.io/query-language/#indexing-with-custom-tokenizers).
* Support for CJK languages in the full-text index.

### Changed

#### Running Dgraph

* We have consolidated all the `server`, `zero`, `live/bulk-loader` binaries into a single `dgraph` binary for convenience. Instructions for running Dgraph can be found in the [docs](https://docs.dgraph.io/get-started/).
* For Dgraph server, Raft ids can be assigned automatically. A user can optionally still specify an ID, via `--idx` flag.
* `--peer` flag which was used to specify another Zero instance’s IP address is being replaced by `--zero` flag to indicate the address corresponds to Dgraph zero.
* `port`, `grpc_port` and `worker_port` flags have been removed from Dgraph server and Zero. The ports are:

- Internal Grpc: 7080
- HTTP: 8080
- External Grpc: 9080 (Dgraph server only)

Users can set `port_offset` flag, to modify these fixed ports.

#### Queries

* Queries, mutations and schema updates are done through separate endpoints. **Queries can no longer have a mutation block.**
* Queries can be done via `Query` Grpc endpoint (it was called `Run` before) or the `/query` HTTP handler.
* `_uid_` is renamed to `uid`. So queries now need to request for `uid`. Example
```
{
  bladerunner(func: eq(name@en, "Blade Runner")) {
    uid
    name@en
  }
}
```
* Facets response structure has been modified and is a lot flatter. Facet key is now `predicate|facet_name`.
Examples for [Go client](https://godoc.org/github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/client#example-Txn-Mutate-Facets) and [HTTP](https://docs.dgraph.io/query-language/#facets-edge-attributes).
* Query latency is now returned as numeric (ns) instead of string. 
* [`Recurse`](https://docs.dgraph.io/query-language/#recurse-query) is now a directive. So queries with `recurse` keyword at root won't work anymore.
* Syntax for [`count` at root](https://docs.dgraph.io/query-language/#count) has changed. You need to ask for `count(uid)`, instead of `count()`.

#### Mutations

* Mutations can only be done via `Mutate` Grpc endpoint or via [`/mutate` HTTP handler](https://docs.dgraph.io/clients/#transactions). 
* `Mutate` Grpc endpoint can be used to set/ delete JSON, or set/ delete a list of NQuads and set/ delete raw RDF strings.
* Mutation blocks don't require the mutation keyword anymore. Here is an example of the new syntax.
```
{
  set {
    <name> <is> <something> .
    <hometown> <is> "San Francisco" .
  }
}
```
* [`Upsert`](https://docs.dgraph.io/v0.8.3/query-language/#upsert) directive and [mutation variables](https://docs.dgraph.io/v0.8.3/query-language/#variables-in-mutations) go away. Both these functionalities can now easily be achieved via transactions.

#### Schema

* `<*> <pred> <*>` operations, that is deleting a predicate can't be done via mutations anymore. They need to be done via `Alter` Grpc endpoint or via the `/alter` HTTP handler.
* Drop all is now done via `Alter`.
* Schema updates are now done via `Alter` Grpc endpoint or via `/alter` HTTP handler.

#### Go client

* `Query` Grpc endpoint returns response in JSON under `Json` field instead of protocol buffer. `client.Unmarshal` method also goes away from the Go client. Users can use `json.Unmarshal` for unmarshalling the response.
* Response for predicate of type `geo` can be unmarshalled into a struct. Example [here](https://godoc.org/github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/client#example-package--SetObject).
* `Node` and `Edge` structs go away along with the `SetValue...` methods. We recommend using [`SetJson`](https://godoc.org/github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/client#example-package--SetObject) and `DeleteJson` fields to do mutations. 
* Examples of how to use transactions using the client can be found at https://docs.dgraph.io/clients/#go. 

### Removed
- Embedded dgraph goes away. We haven’t seen much usage of this feature. And it adds unnecessary maintenance overhead to the code.
- Dgraph live no longer stores external ids. And hence the `xid` flag is gone.
