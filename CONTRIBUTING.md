## Getting Started

- Read the [Getting Started Guide](https://dgraph.io/docs/get-started/)
- [Take the Dgraph tour](https://dgraph.io/tour/)

## Setting Up the Development Environment

### Prerequisites

- Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (may be already installed on your system, or available through your OS package manager)
- Install [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) (may be already installed on your system, or available through your OS package manager)
- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
- [Install Go 1.13 or above](https://golang.org/doc/install).

### Setup Dgraph from source repo

It's best to put the Dgraph repo somewhere in `$GOPATH`.

    $ mkdir -p "$(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/dgraph-io"
    $ cd "$(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/dgraph-io"
    $ git clone https://github.com/hypermodeinc/dgraph.git
    $ cd ./dgraph
    $ make install

This will put the source code in a Git repo under `$GOPATH/src/github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph` and compile the binaries to `$GOPATH/bin`.

### Setup Badger from source repo

Dgraph source repo vendors its own version of Badger. If you are just working on Dgraph, you do not necessarily need to check out Badger from its own repo. However, if you want to contribute to Badger as well, you will need to check it out from its own repo.


    $ go get -t -v github.com/dgraph-io/badger

This will put the source code in a Git repo under `$GOPATH/src/github.com/dgraph-io/badger`.

### Protocol buffers

We use [protocol buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) to serialize data between our server and the Go client and also for inter-worker communication. If you make any changes to the `.proto` files, you would have to recompile them. 

Install the `protoc` compiler which is required for compiling proto files used for gRPC communication. Get `protoc` version 3.0.0 or above from [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases/latest) (look for the binary releases at the bottom, or compile from sources [following the instructions](https://github.com/google/protobuf/tree/main/src)).

We use [gogo protobuf](https://github.com/gogo/protobuf) in Dgraph. To get the protocol buffer compiler plugin from gogo run


    $ go get -u github.com/gogo/protobuf/protoc-gen-gofast

To compile the proto file using the `protoc` plugin and the gogo compiler plugin run the command `make regenerate` from within the directory containing the `.proto` files.


    $ cd protos
    $ make regenerate

This should generate the required `.pb.go` file.

### Build Dgraph

You can build Dgraph using `make dgraph` or `make install`
which add the version information to the binary.

- `make dgraph`: Creates a `dgraph` binary at `./dgraph/dgraph`
- `make install`: Creates a `dgraph` binary at `$GOPATH/bin/dgraph`. You should add
  `$GOPATH/bin` to your `$PATH` if it isn't there already.

```sh
$ make install

### Build Docker Image

```sh
make image-local
```

To build a test Docker image from source, use `make image-local`. This builds a linux-compatible 
Dgraph binary using `make dgraph` and creates a Docker image tagged `dgraph/dgraph:local`.
You can then use this local image to test Dgraph in your local Docker setup.

For release images, follow [Doing a release](#doing-a-release). It creates
Docker images that contains `dgraph` and `badger` commands.

### Testing

Dgraph employs a ~~complex~~ sophisticated testing framework that includes extensive test coverage. 
Due to the comprehensive nature of these tests, a complete test run can take several hours, depending
on your hardware. To manage this complex testing process efficiently, we've developed a custom test 
framework implemented in Go, which resides in the [./t](/t) directory. This specialized framework provides
enhanced control and flexibility beyond what's available through standard Go testing framework.

For dependencies, runner flags and instructions for running tests on non-Linux machines, see 
the [README](t/README.md) in the [*t*](t) folder.

 **NOTE**: Non-integration unit tests exist for many core packages that can be exercised without invoking
 the testing framework. For instance, to unit test the core DQL parsing package: `go test github.com/hypermodeinc/dgraph/v24/dql`

### Guidelines

Over years of writing big scalable systems, we are convinced that striving for simplicity wherever possible is the only way to build robust systems. This simplicity could be in design, could be in coding, or could be achieved by rewriting an entire module, that you may have painstakingly finished yesterday.

- **Pull requests are welcome**, as long as you're willing to put in the effort to meet the guidelines. After you fork dgraph, create your pull request against our `main` branch
- Contributors are required to execute our [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://cla-assistant.io/dgraph-io/dgraph)
- Aim for clear, well written, maintainable code
- Simple and minimal approach to features, like Go
- New features must include passing unit tests, and integration tests when appropriate
- Refactoring existing code now for better performance, better readability or better testability wins over adding a new feature
- Don't add a function to a module that you don't use right now, or doesn't clearly enable a planned functionality
- Don't ship a half done feature, which would require significant alterations to work fully
- Avoid [Technical debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt) like cancer
- Leave the code cleaner than when you began

### Code style
- We're following [Go Code Review](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments)
- Use `go fmt` to format your code before committing
- If you see *any code* which clearly violates the style guide, please fix it and send a pull request. No need to ask for permission
- Avoid unnecessary vertical spaces. Use your judgment or follow the code review comments
- Wrap your code and comments to 120 characters, unless doing so makes the code less legible

### License Header

Every new source file must begin with a license header.

### Signed Commits

Signed commits help in verifying the authenticity of the contributor. We use signed commits in Dgraph, and we prefer it, though it's not compulsory to have signed commits. This is a recommended step for people who intend to contribute to Dgraph on a regular basis.

Follow instructions to generate and setup GPG keys for signing code commits on this [Github Help page](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-commits-with-gpg/).
