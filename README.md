Dgraph's goal is to provide [Google](https://www.google.com) production level scale and throughput,
with low enough latency to be serving real time user queries, over terabytes of structured data.
Dgraph supports [GraphQL-like query syntax](https://docs.dgraph.io/master/query-language/), and responds in [JSON](http://www.json.org/) and [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) over [GRPC](http://www.grpc.io/).

**To get started with Dgraph, follow:**

- Installation to queries in 7 minutes via [docs.dgraph.io](https://docs.dgraph.io/get-started/).

## Current Status

Dgraph is [currently at version
0.8.x](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/releases).  We have largely frozen
the feature set at this point, and focusing solely on stability, performance and
robustness.  We recommend using it in your projects. If you plan to use Dgraph
for user-facing production environment, [come talk to
