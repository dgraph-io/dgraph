Dgraph's goal is to provide [Google](https://www.google.com) production level scale and throughput,
with low enough latency to be serving real time user queries, over terabytes of structured data.
Dgraph supports [GraphQL-like query syntax](https://wiki.dgraph.io/Query_Language_Spec), and responds in [JSON](http://www.json.org/) and [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) over [GRPC](http://www.grpc.io/).

## Get Started
**To get started with Dgraph, follow [this 5-step tutorial](https://wiki.dgraph.io/Get_Started).**

## Current Status

Dgraph is currently at version 0.7. It has 90% of the features planned for v1.0; and implements RAFT protocol for data replication, high availability and crash recovery. We recommend using it for internal projects at companies. If you plan to use Dgraph for user-facing production environment, [come talk to us](https://discuss.dgraph.io).
