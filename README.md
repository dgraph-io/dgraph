Dgraph is a horizontally scalable and distributed GraphQL database with a graph backend. It provides ACID transactions, consistent replication and linearizable reads. It's built from ground up to perform for
a rich set of queries. Being a native GraphQL database, it tightly controls how the
data is arranged on disk to optimize for query performance and throughput,
reducing disk seeks and network calls in a cluster.


Dgraph's goal is to provide [Google](https://www.google.com) production level scale and throughput,
with low enough latency to be serving real time user queries, over terabytes of structured data.
Dgraph supports [GraphQL query syntax](https://dgraph.io/docs/master/query-language/), and responds in [JSON](http://www.json.org/) and [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) over [GRPC](http://www.grpc.io/) and HTTP.

## Status

Dgraph is [at version 20.07.2][rel] and is production ready. Apart from the vast open source community, it is being used in
production at multiple Fortune 500 companies, and by
[Intuit Katlas](https://github.com/intuit/katlas) and [VMware Purser](https://github.com/vmware/purser).

## Quick Install

The quickest way to install Dgraph is to run this command on Linux or Mac.

```bash
curl https://get.dgraph.io -sSf | bash
```

## Install with Docker

If you're using Docker, you can use the [official Dgraph image](https://hub.docker.com/r/dgraph/dgraph/).

```bash
docker pull dgraph/dgraph:latest
```

## Install from Source

If you want to install from source, install Go 1.13+ or later and the following dependencies:

Ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gcc make
```

Then clone the Dgraph repository and use `make install` to install the Dgraph binary to `$GOPATH/bin`.


```bash
git clone https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph.git
cd ./dgraph
make install
```

## Get Started
**To get started with Dgraph, follow:**

- Installation to queries in 3 steps via [dgraph.io/docs/](https://dgraph.io/docs/get-started/).
- A longer interactive tutorial via [dgraph.io/tour/](https://dgraph.io/tour/).
- Tutorial and
presentation videos on [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCghE41LR8nkKFlR3IFTRO4w/featured).

## Is Dgraph the right choice for me?

- Do you have more than 10 SQL tables, connected to each other via foreign keys?
- Do you have sparse data, which doesn't elegantly fit into SQL tables?
- Do you want a simple and flexible schema, which is readable and maintainable
  over time?
- Do you care about speed and performance at scale?

If the answers to the above are YES, then Dgraph would be a great fit for your
application. Dgraph provides NoSQL like scalability while providing SQL like
transactions and ability to select, filter and aggregate data points. It
combines that with distributed joins, traversals and graph operations, which
makes it easy to build applications with it.
