Dgraph is an open source, horizontally scalable and distributed graph database, providing ACID transactions, consistent replication and linearizable reads. It's built from ground up to perform for
a rich set of queries. Being a native graph database, it tightly controls how the
data is arranged on disk to optimize for query performance and throughput,
reducing disk seeks and network calls in a cluster.

Dgraph's goal is to provide [Google](https://www.google.com) production level scale and throughput,
with low enough latency to be serving real time user queries, over terabytes of structured data.
Dgraph supports [GraphQL-like query syntax](https://docs.dgraph.io/master/query-language/), and responds in [JSON](http://www.json.org/) and [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) over [GRPC](http://www.grpc.io/) and HTTP.

## Get Started
**To get started with Dgraph, follow:**

- Installation to queries in 7 minutes via [docs.dgraph.io](https://docs.dgraph.io/get-started/).
- A longer interactive tutorial via [tour.dgraph.io](https://tour.dgraph.io).
- Tutorial and
presentation videos on [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCghE41LR8nkKFlR3IFTRO4w/featured).

## Current Status

Dgraph is [currently at version
0.8.x](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/releases).  We have largely frozen
the feature set at this point, and focusing solely on stability, performance and
robustness.  We recommend using it in your projects. If you plan to use Dgraph
for user-facing production environment, [come talk to
us](mailto:manish@dgraph.io).

## Is Dgraph the right choice for me?

- Do you have more than 10 SQL tables, connected to each other via foreign ids?
- Do you have sparse data, which doesn't correctly fit into SQL tables?
- Do you want a simple and flexible schema, which is readable and maintainable
  over time?
- Do you care about horizontal scalability?

If the answers to the above are YES, then Dgraph would be a great fit for your
application. Dgraph provides NoSQL like scalability while providing SQL like
transactions and ability to select, filter and aggregate data points. It
combines that with distributed joins, traversals and graph operations, which
makes it easy to build applications with it.
