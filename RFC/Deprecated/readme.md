## Deprecated

The "Deprecated" directory contains outdated or replaced proposals for changes to the Dgraph Core. These proposals may
have been superseded by more recent or better-designed solutions, or may have been determined to be unnecessary or
unfeasible. This directory serves as an archive of past discussions and decisions made within the Dgraph Core
development community, and may be useful for reference when designing new proposals or evaluating the history of the
project.

To open a PR with your deprecation proposal please use the template found in the root of this repository.
