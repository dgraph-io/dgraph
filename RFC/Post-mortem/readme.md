## Post-mortem

The "Post-mortem" directory is intended to hold information about failed or discontinued proposals for changes to the
Dgraph Core. This information can include the original proposal, a detailed explanation of the reasons why it was not
implemented, and any lessons learned from the process. This information can be valuable for future proposal writers and
contributors, as it provides insight into the challenges and considerations that may arise when proposing changes to the
Dgraph Core. Additionally, the post-mortems can help the Dgraph Core maintainers to understand the historical context of
failed proposals and make better decisions about future changes to the system. By providing a centralized location for
this information, the "Post-mortem" directory can help to ensure that the decision-making process is transparent,
accountable, and informed by past experiences.
