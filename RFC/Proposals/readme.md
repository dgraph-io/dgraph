## Proposals

The "Proposals" directory is where you can find all the proposed changes and additions to the Dgraph Core and others. It
contains the Request for Comment (RFC) documents. It is where anyone can submit their ideas for improving the Dgraph
Core, whether it is through discussion on the forum or through independent research and development. If you have
knowledge of the Core code and sufficient understanding of the problem that you're trying to solve, you can submit your
proposal to this directory.

Note that while discussion of proposals is encouraged, it is not required. The goal is to provide a clear and concise
description of each proposal, to allow others to understand the proposed changes and to make informed decisions about
the future direction of the Dgraph Core.

To open a PR with your RFC proposal please use the template found in the root of this repository.
