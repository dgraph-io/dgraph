Steps to move predicate p from g1 to g2.
Design change:
• If you’re not the leader, don’t talk to zero.
• Let the leader send you updates via proposals.

Move:
• Dgraph zero would decide that G1 should not serve P, G2 should serve it.
• Zero would propose that G1 is read-only for predicate P. This would propagate to the cluster.

• Zero would tell G1 to move P to G2 (Endpoint: Zero → G1)

This would trigger G1 to get latest state. Wait for it.
• G1 would propose this state to it’s followers.
• G1 after proposing would do a call to G2, and start streaming.
• Before G2 starts accepting, it should delete any current keys for P.
• It should tell Zero whether it succeeded or failed. (Endpoint: G1 → Zero)

• Zero would then propose that G2 is serving P (or G1 is, if fail above) P would RW.
• G1 gets this, G2 gets this.
• Both propagate this to their followers.

Cleanup:
• The iterator for tablet update can do the cleanup, if it’s not serving the predicate.
