# This Docker Compose file can be used to quickly bootup Dgraph Zero
# and Alpha in different Docker containers.

# It mounts /tmp/data on the host machine to /dgraph within the
# container. You can change /tmp/data to a more appropriate location.
# Run `docker-compose up` to start Dgraph.
# NOTE: whitelisting is set to private address ranges, this is ONLY for a local setup
#       please change it accordingly for your production setup
#       more here https://dgraph.io/docs/deploy/dgraph-administration/#whitelisting-admin-operations
