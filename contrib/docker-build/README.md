# Docker build script

This directory contains a Makefile that can be used to build Dgraph inside the
official Dgraph Docker container. This is useful for situations when the host
system cannot be used to build a binary that will work with the container (for
example, if the host system has a different version of glibc).

## Usage

Run `make install` in this directory. The script will ask you for your password
in order to change ownership of the compiled binary. By default, files written
by Docker will be owned by root. This script also takes care of moving the
binary to $GOPATH/bin.
