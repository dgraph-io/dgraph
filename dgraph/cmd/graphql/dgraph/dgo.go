// Client is the GraphQL API's view of the database.  Rather than relying on
// dgo, we rely on this abstraction and thus it's easier to run the GraphQL API
// in other environments: e.g. it could run on an alpha with no change to the
// GraphQL layer - would just need a implementation of this that forwards the
// GraphQuery straight in.  Similarly, we could allow the GraphQL API to push
// GraphQuery to alpha, so we don't have to stringify -> reparse etc.  Also
// allows exercising some of the particulars around GraphQL error processing
// without needing a Dgraph instance the reproduces the exact error conditions.
