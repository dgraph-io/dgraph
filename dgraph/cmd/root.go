Dgraph is an open source, horizontally scalable and distributed graph database,
providing ACID transactions, consistent replication and linearizable reads.
It's built from ground up to perform for a rich set of queries. Being a native
graph database, it tightly controls how the data is arranged on disk to optimize
for query performance and throughput, reducing disk seeks and network calls in a
cluster.
