# Dockerfile for Dgraph

# For your convenience:
#   docker build -t dgraph/release .
#   docker run -it dgraph/release bash

# We need libc (not the lightweight version). Otherwise, dgraph cannot run.
FROM frolvlad/alpine-glibc

# We need libstdc++ as the embedded binaries are dynamically linked with libstdc++.
# You might see warnings such as the following, but dgraph will run fine.
# Your stdout won't be flooded with these warnings.
#   dgraph: /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.6: no version information available (required by dgraph)
RUN apk add --no-cache bash wget curl libstdc++

# Get embedded binaries from Dgraph.
RUN curl https://get.dgraph.io | bash

# Create the dgraph and data directory. These directories should be mapped
# to host machine for persistence.
RUN mkdir /dgraph && mkdir /data

# Sequence of commands to bulkload some sample data:
#   cd /data
