Using a map made up of 32 buckets, with each bucket holding it's own lock.

Based on benchmarks, a Get should take close to 1 microsecond.
In this case, u1 has 110K Gets, while u10 has only ~3000. So, that's good.
But we see a sudden jump to 37k Gets (16%), which took over 1 millisecond!
And 24k requests (~10%) took over a second to return. That's very erratic behaviour.
Overall, only 72% of Gets took under 10 microseconds.
