This is a post to announce DGraph, an open source, distributed, scalable native graph database. DGraph is designed to handle terabytes of structured data, over commodity hardware.

The design and inspiration is drawn from my experiences working in Google Knowledge Infra group. DGraph is under active development, and is looking to hire talented engineers.

Github page: https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph

Features:
- Aimed at real time user queries.
- Low Latency, High Throughput.
- Distributed Native Graph database.
- Network calls are proportional to complexity of query, not number of results.
- Supports GraphQL as query language.
- (planned) Shard replication, High availability, Crash resilience.
- (roadmap) https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/1

Performance:
- Loads up 21M RDFs from Freebase Film data in 20 mins.
- Runs complex queries about Steven Spielberg in ~200ms.

Happy to answer any questions!

Cheers,
Manish
