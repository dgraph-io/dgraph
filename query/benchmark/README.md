Just run `run.sh` to regenerate these gob files. These gob files are just
serialized SubGraph objects.

Just two things to note before running `run.sh`:

1. Run it in this directory so that it generates the files here.
1. Remember to specify `DATADIR`. This is the location of your posting list data after running `dgraphloader`.
