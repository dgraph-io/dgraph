				// another change in 20.07.0 version is if someone was having types/predicates in
				// reserved namespace, then data should be migrated for such cases,
				// to not use the reserved namespace. Migration is expected to be done by the user,
				// and we will only provide a documentation mentioning the steps to be taken.
				// This is not being automated because:
				// 	1. There is very less chance that someone was using the reserved namespace,
				//	so this automation may not be used at all.
				// 	2. The data migration can be huge, if needed to migrate. The automated code
				//	can't handle every scenario. So, it is best to let the user do it.
