# This script is meant to be used to update the version of rocksdb in this repo.
#
# To use it, update the version number in the URL to the tar.gz file below, then
# run it, starting from a clean repo. If you're lucky, everything will just
# work, but you may get an error about a patch not applying cleanly. If that's
# the case, try to fix up the patch file so that it will apply cleanly, then
# reset the rest of the repository and try again.
#
# Once things have run cleanly, you should have a fairly large diff of the
# actual rocksdb code, potentially along with some added or removed symlink
# files in the base of the repository.
#
# Once you've successfully run this script, you should also manually verify that
# the recommended build flags for darwin and linux mostly match up with what's
# specified in the cgo_flags.go file in the base of the repo.
# To do so go through the below process on both a mac machine and a linux
# machine (or a linux docker container):
#   cd internal
#   ./build_tools/build_detect_platform tmp.txt
#   # Manually compare the PLATFORM_CCFLAGS and PLATFORM_CXXFLAGS to what's in
#   # cgo_flags.go
#
# Ask @tamird if you run into issues along the way.
#
# After committing locally you should run the command below to ensure your repo
# is in a clean state and then build/test cockroachdb with the new version:
#   git clean -dxf
