  //    this is used by ShouldDelete() to prevent deletion of keys that are
  //    covered by range tombstones in other snapshot stripes. This constructor
  //    is used for writes (flush/compaction). All DB snapshots are provided

  //    snapshot.

  //    initialization of heap-allocating members (in Rep) until the first range
  //    deletion is encountered. This constructor is used in case of reads (get/

  // For example, if we invoke Next() on an iterator, kForwardTraversal should

  //    to the range tombstones added to this file such that the read path does
