  // If we're only going to end up waiting a short period of time,
  // it can be a lot more efficient to call std::this_thread::yield()
  // in a loop than to block in StateMutex().  For reference, on my 4.0
  // SELinux test server with support for syscall auditing enabled, the
  // minimum latency between FUTEX_WAKE to returning from FUTEX_WAIT is
  // 2.7 usec, and the average is more like 10 usec.  That can be a big
  // drag on RockDB's single-writer design.  Of course, spinning is a
  // bad idea if other threads are waiting to run or if we're going to
  // wait for a long time.  How do we decide?
  //
  // We break waiting into 3 categories: short-uncontended,
  // short-contended, and long.  If we had an oracle, then we would always
  // spin for short-uncontended, always block for long, and our choice for
  // short-contended might depend on whether we were trying to optimize
  // RocksDB throughput or avoid being greedy with system resources.
  //
  // Bucketing into short or long is easy by measuring elapsed time.
  // Differentiating short-uncontended from short-contended is a bit
  // trickier, but not too bad.  We could look for involuntary context
  // switches using getrusage(RUSAGE_THREAD, ..), but it's less work
  // (portability code and CPU) to just look for yield calls that take
  // longer than we expect.  sched_yield() doesn't actually result in any
  // context switch overhead if there are no other runnable processes
  // on the current core, in which case it usually takes less than
  // a microsecond.
  //
  // There are two primary tunables here: the threshold between "short"
  // and "long" waits, and the threshold at which we suspect that a yield
  // is slow enough to indicate we should probably block.  If these
  // thresholds are chosen well then CPU-bound workloads that don't
  // have more threads than cores will experience few context switches
  // (voluntary or involuntary), and the total number of context switches
  // (voluntary and involuntary) will not be dramatically larger (maybe
  // 2x) than the number of voluntary context switches that occur when
  // --max_yield_wait_micros=0.
  //
  // There's another constant, which is the number of slow yields we will
  // tolerate before reversing our previous decision.  Solitary slow
  // yields are pretty common (low-priority small jobs ready to run),
  // so this should be at least 2.  We set this conservatively to 3 so
