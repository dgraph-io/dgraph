# baseurl determines the subpath of your site. For example if you're using an
# organisation.github.io/reponame/ basic site URL, then baseurl would be set
# as "/reponame" but leave blank if you have a top-level domain URL as it is
# now set to "" by default as discussed in:
# http://jekyllrb.com/news/2016/10/06/jekyll-3-3-is-here/
baseurl: ""

# the base hostname & protocol for your site
# If baseurl is set, then the absolute url for your site would be url/baseurl
# This was also be set to the right thing automatically for local development

  # primary should be a vivid color that reflects the project's brand
  primary: "#2a2a2a"
  # secondary should be a subtle light or dark color used on page backgrounds
  secondary: "#f9f9f9"
  # Use the following to specify whether the previous two colours are 'light'
  # or 'dark' and therefore what colors can be overlaid on them

# Blog posts are builtin to Jekyll by default, with the `_posts` directory.
# Here you can specify other types of documentation. The names here are `docs`
# and `top-level`. This means their content will be in `_docs` and `_top-level`.
# The permalink format is also given.
