  //    be incremented in Next().
  // 2. when calling Next(), we need to skip internal entries for the previous
  //    keys that are overwritten.
  // 3. when calling Next(), Seek() or SeekToFirst(), after previous key
  //    before calling Next(), the seek key in Seek() or the beginning for
  //    SeekToFirst(), there may be one or more deleted keys before the next
  //    valid key that the operation should place the iterator to. We need
  //    to skip both of the tombstone and updates hidden by the tombstones. The
  //    tombstones are not included in this counter, while previous updates
  //    hidden by the tombstones will be included here.
  // 4. symmetric cases for Prev() and SeekToLast()
  // We sometimes also skip entries of more recent updates than the snapshot
  // we read from, but they are not included in this counter.
