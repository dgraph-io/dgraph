// Date tiered database is a wrapper of DB that implements
// a simplified DateTieredCompactionStrategy by using multiple column famillies
// as time windows.
//
// DateTieredDB provides an interface similar to DB, but it assumes that user
// provides keys with last 8 bytes encoded as timestamp in seconds. DateTieredDB
// is assigned with a TTL to declare when data should be deleted.
//
// DateTieredDB hides column families layer from standard RocksDB instance. It
// uses multiple column families to manage time series data, each containing a
// specific range of time. Column families are named by its maximum possible
// timestamp. A column family is created automatically when data newer than
// latest timestamp of all existing column families. The time range of a column
// family is configurable by `column_family_interval`. By doing this, we
// guarantee that compaction will only happen in a column family.
//
// DateTieredDB is assigned with a TTL. When all data in a column family are
// expired (CF_Timestamp <= CUR_Timestamp - TTL), we directly drop the whole
// column family.
//
// TODO(jhli): This is only a simplified version of DTCS. In a complete DTCS,
// time windows can be merged over time, so that older time windows will have
// larger time range. Also, compaction are executed only for adjacent SST files
// to guarantee there is no time overlap between SST files.
