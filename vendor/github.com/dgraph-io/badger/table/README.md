Size of table is 123,217,667 bytes for all benchmarks.

# BenchmarkRead

Size of table is 123,217,667 bytes, which is ~118MB.

The rate is ~762MB/s using LoadToRAM (when table is in RAM).

To read a 64MB table, this would take ~0.084s, which is negligible.

# BenchmarkReadAndBuild
```go
$ go test -bench BenchmarkReadAndBuild -run ^$ -count 3
goos: linux
goarch: amd64
pkg: github.com/dgraph-io/badger/table
BenchmarkReadAndBuild-16    	       1	1026755231 ns/op
BenchmarkReadAndBuild-16    	       1	1009543316 ns/op
BenchmarkReadAndBuild-16    	       1	1039920546 ns/op
PASS
ok  	github.com/dgraph-io/badger/table	12.081s
```

The rate is ~123MB/s. To build a 64MB table, this would take ~0.56s. Note that this
does NOT include the flushing of the table to disk. All we are doing above is
reading one table (which is in RAM) and write one table in memory.

The table building takes 0.56-0.084s ~ 0.4823s.

# BenchmarkReadMerged
Below, we merge 5 tables. The total size remains unchanged at ~122M.

```go
$ go test -bench ReadMerged -run ^$ -count 3
goos: linux
goarch: amd64
pkg: github.com/dgraph-io/badger/table
BenchmarkReadMerged-16    	       2	 977588975 ns/op
BenchmarkReadMerged-16    	       2	 982140738 ns/op
BenchmarkReadMerged-16    	       2	 962046017 ns/op
PASS
ok  	github.com/dgraph-io/badger/table	27.433s
```

The rate is ~120MB/s. To read a 64MB table using merge iterator, this would take ~0.53s.

# BenchmarkRandomRead

For random read benchmarking, we are randomly reading a key and verifying its value.

# DB Open benchmark
1. Create badger DB with 2 billion key-value pairs (about 380GB of data)
```
badger fill -m 2000 --dir="/tmp/data" --sorted
```
2. Clear buffers and swap memory
```
free -mh && sync && echo 3 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches && sudo swapoff -a && sudo swapon -a && free -mh
```
Also flush disk buffers
```
blockdev --flushbufs /dev/nvme0n1p4
```
3. Run the benchmark
```
go test -run=^$ github.com/dgraph-io/badger -bench ^BenchmarkDBOpen$ -benchdir="/tmp/data" -v
