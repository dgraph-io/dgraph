# Dgraph Wiki

We use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/s) for our documentation. To setup it up locally

1. Download and install hugo from [here](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/releases).
2. From within the `wiki` folder, run the command below to get the theme.
```
cd themes && git clone https://github.com/dgraph-io/hugo-docs
```
3. Run `hugo server` from within the `wiki` folder and goto `http://localhost:1313` to see the Wiki.

Now you can make changes to the docs and see them being updated instantly thanks to Hugo.
