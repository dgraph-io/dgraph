The official Java client [can be found here](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph4j). 
Follow the instructions in the [README](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph4j#readme) to get it up and running.

More details on the supported versions can be found at [this link](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph4j#supported-versions).

We also have a [DgraphJavaSample] project, which contains an end-to-end
working example of how to use the Java client.
