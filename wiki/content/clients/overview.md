## Implementation

Clients can communicate with the server in two different ways:

- **Via [gRPC](http://www.grpc.io/).** Internally this uses [Protocol
  Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) (the proto file
used by Dgraph is located at
[api.proto](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgo/blob/master/protos/api.proto)).

- **Via HTTP.** There are various endpoints, each accepting and returning JSON.
  There is a one to one correspondence between the HTTP endpoints and the gRPC
service methods.


It's possible to interface with Dgraph directly via gRPC or HTTP. However, if a
client library exists for you language, this will be an easier option.

For multi-node setups, predicates are assigned to the group that first sees that
predicate. Dgraph also automatically moves predicate data to different groups in
order to balance predicate distribution. This occurs automatically every 10
minutes. It's possible for clients to aid this process by communicating with all
Dgraph instances. For the Go client, this means passing in one
`*grpc.ClientConn` per Dgraph instance. Mutations will be made in a round robin
fashion, resulting in an initially semi random predicate distribution.

### Transactions

Dgraph clients perform mutations and queries using transactions. A
transaction bounds a sequence of queries and mutations that are committed by
Dgraph as a single unit: that is, on commit, either all the changes are accepted
by Dgraph or none are.

A transaction always sees the database state at the moment it began, plus any
changes it makes --- changes from concurrent transactions aren't visible.

On commit, Dgraph will abort a transaction, rather than committing changes, when
a conflicting, concurrently running transaction has already been committed.  Two
transactions conflict when both transactions:

- write values to the same scalar predicate of the same node (e.g both
  attempting to set a particular node's `address` predicate); or
- write to a singular `uid` predicate of the same node (changes to `[uid]` predicates can be concurrently written); or
- write a value that conflicts on an index for a predicate with `@upsert` set in the schema (see [upserts]({{< relref "howto/upserts.md">}})).

When a transaction is aborted, all its changes are discarded.  Transactions can be manually aborted.
