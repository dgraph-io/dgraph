The official Python client [can be found here](https://github.com/dgraph-io/pydgraph). 
Follow the instructions in the [README](https://github.com/dgraph-io/pydgraph#readme) to get it
up and running.

More details on the supported versions can be found at [this link](https://github.com/dgraph-io/pydgraph#supported-versions).

We also have a [simple example](https://github.com/dgraph-io/pydgraph/tree/master/examples/simple)
project, which contains an end-to-end working example of how to use the Python client.
