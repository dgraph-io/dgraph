Alpha exposes the option `--badger.compression_level` to configure the compression
level for data on disk using Zstd compression. The option can be set as

```sh
dgraph alpha --badger.compression_level=xxx
```

A higher compression level is more CPU intensive but offers a better compression
ratio. The default level is 3.

This option is available in v20.03.1 and later.
