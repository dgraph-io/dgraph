{{% notice "note" %}}
Be aware that using this script will overwrite the installed version and can lead to compatibility problems. For example, if you were using version v1.0.5 and forced the installation of v2.0.0-Beta, the existing data won't be compatible with the new version. The data must be [exported]({{< relref "deploy/dgraph-administration.md#exporting-database" >}}) before running this script and reimported to the new cluster running the updated version.

## Manual download [optional]

If you don't want to follow the automatic installation method, you could manually download the appropriate tar for your platform from **[Dgraph releases](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/releases)**. After downloading the tar for your platform from Github, extract the binary to `/usr/local/bin` like so.

```sh
# For Linux
$ sudo tar -C /usr/local/bin -xzf dgraph-linux-amd64-VERSION.tar.gz

# For Mac
$ sudo tar -C /usr/local/bin -xzf dgraph-darwin-amd64-VERSION.tar.gz

# Test that it worked fine, by running:
dgraph
```

## Building from Source

{{% notice "note" %}}
You can build the Ratel UI from source seperately following its build
[instructions](https://github.com/dgraph-io/ratel/blob/master/INSTRUCTIONS.md).
Ratel UI is distributed via Dgraph releases using any of the download methods
listed above.
{{% /notice %}}

Make sure you have [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) v1.11+ installed.

You'll need the following dependencies to install Dgraph using `make`:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gcc make
```

After installing Go, run
```sh
# This should install dgraph binary in your $GOPATH/bin.

git clone https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph.git
cd ./dgraph
make install
```

If you get errors related to `grpc` while building them, your
`go-grpc` version might be outdated. We don't vendor in `go-grpc`(because it
causes issues while using the Go client). Update your `go-grpc` by running.
```sh
go get -u -v google.golang.org/grpc
```
