There are two different tools that can be used for fast data loading:

- `dgraph live` runs the Dgraph Live Loader
- `dgraph bulk` runs the Dgraph Bulk Loader

{{% notice "note" %}} Both tools only accept [RDF N-Quad/Triple
data](https://www.w3.org/TR/n-quads/) or JSON in plain or gzipped format. Data
in other formats must be converted.{{% /notice %}}

## Live Loader

Dgraph Live Loader (run with `dgraph live`) is a small helper program which reads RDF N-Quads from a gzipped file, batches them up, creates mutations (using the go client) and shoots off to Dgraph.

Dgraph Live Loader correctly handles assigning unique IDs to blank nodes across multiple files, and can optionally persist them to disk to save memory, in case the loader was re-run.

{{% notice "note" %}} Dgraph Live Loader can optionally write the xid->uid mapping to a directory specified using the `--xidmap` flag, which can reused
given that live loader completed successfully in the previous run.{{% /notice %}}

```sh
$ dgraph live --help # To see the available flags.

# Read RDFs or JSON from the passed file, and send them to Dgraph on localhost:9080.
$ dgraph live -f <path-to-gzipped-RDF-or-JSON-file>

# Read multiple RDFs or JSON from the passed path, and send them to Dgraph on localhost:9080.
$ dgraph live -f <./path-to-gzipped-RDF-or-JSON-files>

# Read multiple files strictly by name.
$ dgraph live -f <file1.rdf, file2.rdf>

# Use compressed gRPC connections to and from Dgraph.
$ dgraph live -C -f <path-to-gzipped-RDF-or-JSON-file>

# Read RDFs and a schema file and send to Dgraph running at given address.
$ dgraph live -f <path-to-gzipped-RDf-or-JSON-file> -s <path-to-schema-file> -a <dgraph-alpha-address:grpc_port> -z <dgraph-zero-address:grpc_port>
```

### Encrypted imports via Live Loader (Enterprise Feature)

A new flag `--encryption_key_file` is added to the Live Loader. This option is required to decrypt the encrypted export data and schema files. Once the export files are decrypted, the Live Loader streams the data to a live Alpha instance.
Alternatively, starting with v20.07.0, the `vault_*` options can be used to decrypt the encrypted export and schema files.

{{% notice "note" %}}
If the live Alpha instance has encryption turned on, the `p` directory will be encrypted. Otherwise, the `p` directory is unencrypted.
{{% /notice %}}

#### Encrypted RDF/JSON file and schema via Live Loader
`dgraph live -f <path-to-encrypted-gzipped-RDF-or-JSON-file> -s <path-to-encrypted-schema> --encryption_keyfile <path-to-keyfile-to-decrypt-files>`

### Other Live Loader options

`--new_uids` (default: false): Assign new UIDs instead of using the existing
UIDs in data files. This is useful to avoid overriding the data in a DB already
in operation.

`-f, --files`: Location of *.rdf(.gz) or *.json(.gz) file(s) to load. It can
load multiple files in a given path. If the path is a directory, then all files
ending in .rdf, .rdf.gz, .json, and .json.gz will be loaded.

`--format`: Specify file format (rdf or json) instead of getting it from
filenames. This is useful if you need to define a strict format manually.

`-b, --batch` (default: 1000): Number of N-Quads to send as part of a mutation.

`-c, --conc` (default: 10): Number of concurrent requests to make to Dgraph.
Do not confuse with `-C`.

`-C, --use_compression` (default: false): Enable compression for connections to and from the
Alpha server.

`-a, --alpha` (default: `localhost:9080`): Dgraph Alpha gRPC server address to connect for live loading. This can be a comma-separated list of Alphas addresses in the same cluster to distribute the load, e.g.,  `"alpha:grpc_port,alpha2:grpc_port,alpha3:grpc_port"`.

`-x, --xidmap` (default: disabled. Need a path): Store xid to uid mapping to a directory. Dgraph will save all identifiers used in the load for later use in other data ingest operations. The mapping will be saved in the path you provide and you must indicate that same path in the next load. It is recommended to use this flag if you have full control over your identifiers (Blank-nodes). Because the identifier will be mapped to a specific UID.

`--vault_*` flags specifies the Vault server address, role id, secret id and 
field that contains the encryption key that can be used to decrypt the encrypted export. 

## Bulk Loader

{{% notice "note" %}}
It's crucial to tune the bulk loader's flags to get good performance. See the
section below for details.
{{% /notice %}}

Dgraph Bulk Loader serves a similar purpose to the Dgraph Live Loader, but can
only be used to load data into a new cluster. It cannot be run on an existing
Dgraph cluster. Dgraph Bulk Loader is **considerably faster** than the Dgraph
Live Loader and is the recommended way to perform the initial import of large
datasets into Dgraph.

Only one or more Dgraph Zeros should be running for bulk loading. Dgraph Alphas
will be started later.

{{% notice "warning" %}}
Don't use bulk loader once the Dgraph cluster is up and running. Use it to import
your existing data to a new cluster.
{{% /notice %}}

You can [read some technical details](https://blog.dgraph.io/post/bulkloader/)
about the bulk loader on the blog.

See [Fast Data Loading]({{< relref "#fast-data-loading" >}}) for more info about
the expected N-Quads format.

**Reduce shards**: Before running the bulk load, you need to decide how many
Alpha groups will be running when the cluster starts. The number of Alpha groups
will be the same number of reduce shards you set with the `--reduce_shards`
flag. For example, if your cluster will run 3 Alpha with 3 replicas per group,
then there is 1 group and `--reduce_shards` should be set to 1. If your cluster
will run 6 Alphas with 3 replicas per group, then there are 2 groups and
`--reduce_shards` should be set to 2.

**Map shards**: The `--map_shards` option must be set to at least what's set for
`--reduce_shards`. A higher number helps the bulk loader evenly distribute
predicates between the reduce shards.

```sh
$ dgraph bulk -f goldendata.rdf.gz -s goldendata.schema --map_shards=4 --reduce_shards=2 --http localhost:8000 --zero=localhost:5080
```
```
{

	"DataFormat": "",
	"SchemaFile": "goldendata.schema",
	"DgraphsDir": "out",
	"TmpDir": "tmp",

	"HttpAddr": "localhost:8000",
	"IgnoreErrors": false,
	"MapShards": 4,
	"ReduceShards": 2
}
The bulk loader needs to open many files at once. This number depends on the size of the data set loaded, the map file output size, and the level of indexing. 100,000 is adequate for most data set sizes. See `man ulimit` for details of how to change the limit.

```

The output will be generated in the `out` directory by default. Here's the bulk
load output from the example above:

```sh
$ tree ./out
```
```
./out
├── 0
│   └── p
│       ├── 000000.vlog
│       ├── 000002.sst
│       └── MANIFEST
└── 1
    └── p
        ├── 000000.vlog
        ├── 000002.sst
        └── MANIFEST

4 directories, 6 files
```

Because `--reduce_shards` was set to 2, there are two sets of p directories: one
in `./out/0` directory and another in the `./out/1` directory.

Once the output is created, they can be copied to all the servers that will run
Dgraph Alphas. Each Dgraph Alpha must have its own copy of the group's p
directory output. Each replica of the first group should have its own copy of
`./out/0/p`, each replica of the second group should have its own copy of
`./out/1/p`, and so on.

```sh
$ dgraph bulk --help # To see the available flags.

# Read RDFs or JSON from the passed file.
$ dgraph bulk -f <path-to-gzipped-RDF-or-JSON-file> ...

# Read multiple RDFs or JSON from the passed path.
$ dgraph bulk -f <./path-to-gzipped-RDF-or-JSON-files> ...

# Read multiple files strictly by name.
$ dgraph bulk -f <file1.rdf, file2.rdf> ...

```

### Encryption at rest with Bulk Loader (Enterprise Feature)

Even before the Dgraph cluster starts, we can load data using Bulk Loader with the encryption feature turned on. Later we can point the generated `p` directory to a new Alpha server.

Here's an example to run Bulk Loader with a key used to write encrypted data:

```bash
dgraph bulk --encryption_key_file ./enc_key_file -f data.json.gz -s data.schema --map_shards=1 --reduce_shards=1 --http localhost:8000 --zero=localhost:5080
```
Alternatively, starting with v20.07.0, the `vault_*` options can be used to decrypt the encrypted export. 


### Encrypting imports via Bulk Loader (Enterprise Feature)

The Bulk Loader’s `encryption_key_file` option was previously used to encrypt the output `p ` directory. This same option will also be used to decrypt the encrypted export data and schema files.

Another option, `--encrypted`, indicates whether the input `rdf`/`json` data and schema files are encrypted or not. With this switch, we support the use case of migrating data from unencrypted exports to encrypted import.

So, with the above two options we have 4 cases:

1. `--encrypted=true` and no `encryption_key_file`.

Error: If the input is encrypted, a key file must be provided.

2. `--encrypted=true` and `encryption_key_file`=`path to key.

Input is encrypted and output `p` dir is encrypted as well.

3. `--encrypted=false` and no `encryption_key_file`.

Input is not encrypted and the output `p` dir is also not encrypted.   

4. `--encrypted=false` and `encryption_key_file`=`path to key`.

Input is not encrypted but the output is encrypted. (This is the migration use case mentioned above).

Alternatively, starting with v20.07.0, the `vault_*` options can be used instead of the `--encryption_key_file` option above to achieve the same effect except that the keys are sitting in a Vault server. 

### Other Bulk Loader options

`--new_uids` (default: false): Assign new UIDs instead of using the existing
UIDs in data files. This is useful to avoid overriding the data in a DB already
in operation.

`-f, --files`: Location of *.rdf(.gz) or *.json(.gz) file(s) to load. It can
load multiple files in a given path. If the path is a directory, then all files
ending in .rdf, .rdf.gz, .json, and .json.gz will be loaded.

`--format`: Specify file format (rdf or json) instead of getting it from
filenames. This is useful if you need to define a strict format manually.

`--store_xids`: Generate a xid edge for each node. It will store the XIDs (The identifier / Blank-nodes) in an attribute named `xid` in the entity itself. It is useful if you gonna use [External IDs](/mutations#external-ids).

`--xidmap` (default: disabled. Need a path): Store xid to uid mapping to a directory. Dgraph will save all identifiers used in the load for later use in other data ingest operations. The mapping will be saved in the path you provide and you must indicate that same path in the next load. It is recommended to use this flag if you have full control over your identifiers (Blank-nodes). Because the identifier will be mapped to a specific UID.

`--vault_*` flags specifies the Vault server address, role id, secret id and 
field that contains the encryption key that can be used to decrypt the encrypted export. 

### Tuning & monitoring

#### Performance Tuning

{{% notice "tip" %}}
We highly recommend [disabling swap
space](https://askubuntu.com/questions/214805/how-do-i-disable-swap) when
running Bulk Loader. It is better to fix the parameters to decrease memory
usage, than to have swapping grind the loader down to a halt.
{{% /notice %}}

Flags can be used to control the behaviour and performance characteristics of
the bulk loader. You can see the full list by running `dgraph bulk --help`. In
particular, **the flags should be tuned so that the bulk loader doesn't use more
memory than is available as RAM**. If it starts swapping, it will become
incredibly slow.

**In the map phase**, tweaking the following flags can reduce memory usage:

- The `--num_go_routines` flag controls the number of worker threads. Lowering reduces memory
  consumption.

- The `--mapoutput_mb` flag controls the size of the map output files. Lowering
  reduces memory consumption.

For bigger datasets and machines with many cores, gzip decoding can be a
bottleneck during the map phase. Performance improvements can be obtained by
first splitting the RDFs up into many `.rdf.gz` files (e.g. 256MB each). This
has a negligible impact on memory usage.

**The reduce phase** is less memory heavy than the map phase, although can still
use a lot.  Some flags may be increased to improve performance, *but only if
you have large amounts of RAM*:

- The `--reduce_shards` flag controls the number of resultant Dgraph alpha instances.
  Increasing this increases memory consumption, but in exchange allows for
higher CPU utilization.

- The `--map_shards` flag controls the number of separate map output shards.
  Increasing this increases memory consumption but balances the resultant
Dgraph alpha instances more evenly.

- The `--shufflers` controls the level of parallelism in the shuffle/reduce
  stage. Increasing this increases memory consumption.
