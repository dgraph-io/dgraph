{{% notice "note" %}}
This section refers to the `dgraph cert` command which was introduced in v1.0.9. For previous releases, see the previous [TLS configuration documentation](https://dgraph.io/docs/v1.0.7/deploy/#tls-configuration).
{{% /notice %}}


Connections between client and server can be secured with TLS. Password protected private keys are **not supported**.

{{% notice "tip" %}}If you're generating encrypted private keys with `openssl`, be sure to specify encryption algorithm explicitly (like `-aes256`). This will force `openssl` to include `DEK-Info` header in private key, which is required to decrypt the key by Dgraph. When default encryption is used, `openssl` doesn't write that header and key can't be decrypted.{{% /notice %}}

## Dgraph Certificate Management Tool

The `dgraph cert` program creates and manages CA-signed certificates and private keys using a generated Dgraph Root CA. The `dgraph cert` command simplifies certificate management for you.

```sh
# To see the available flags.
$ dgraph cert --help

# Create Dgraph Root CA, used to sign all other certificates.
$ dgraph cert

# Create node certificate and private key
$ dgraph cert -n localhost

# Create client certificate and private key for mTLS (mutual TLS)
$ dgraph cert -c dgraphuser

# Combine all in one command
$ dgraph cert -n localhost -c dgraphuser

# List all your certificates and keys
$ dgraph cert ls
```

### File naming conventions

To enable TLS you must specify the directory path to find certificates and keys. The default location where the _cert_ command stores certificates (and keys) is `tls` under the Dgraph working directory; where the data files are found. The default dir path can be overridden using the `--dir` option.

```sh
$ dgraph cert --dir ~/mycerts
```

The following file naming conventions are used by Dgraph for proper TLS setup.

| File name | Description | Use |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| ca.crt | Dgraph Root CA certificate | Verify all certificates |
| ca.key | Dgraph CA private key | Validate CA certificate |
| node.crt | Dgraph node certificate | Shared by all nodes for accepting TLS connections |
| node.key | Dgraph node private key | Validate node certificate |
| client._name_.crt | Dgraph client certificate | Authenticate a client _name_ |
| client._name_.key | Dgraph client private key | Validate _name_ client certificate |

The Root CA certificate is used for verifying node and client certificates, if changed you must regenerate all certificates.

For client authentication, each client must have their own certificate and key. These are then used to connect to the Dgraph node(s).

The node certificate `node.crt` can support multiple node names using multiple host names and/or IP address. Just separate the names with commas when generating the certificate.

```sh
$ dgraph cert -n localhost,104.25.165.23,dgraph.io,2400:cb00:2048:1::6819:a417
```

{{% notice "tip" %}}You must delete the old node cert and key before you can generate a new pair.{{% /notice %}}

{{% notice "note" %}}When using host names for node certificates, including _localhost_, your clients must connect to the matching host name -- such as _localhost_ not 127.0.0.1. If you need to use IP addresses, then add them to the node certificate.{{% /notice %}}

### Certificate inspection

The command `dgraph cert ls` lists all certificates and keys in the `--dir` directory (default 'tls'), along with details to inspect and validate cert/key pairs.

Example of command output:

```sh

```

Important points:

* The cert/key pairs should always have matching SHA-256 digests. Otherwise, the cert(s) must be
  regenerated. If the Root CA pair differ, all cert/key must be regenerated; the flag `--force`
  can help.
* All certificates must pass Dgraph CA verification.
* All key files should have the least access permissions, especially the `ca.key`, but be readable.
* Key files won't be overwritten if they have limited access, even with `--force`.
* Node certificates are only valid for the hosts listed.
* Client certificates are only valid for the named client/user.

## TLS Options

The following configuration options are available for Alpha:

* `--tls_dir string` - TLS dir path; this enables TLS connections (usually 'tls').
* `--tls_use_system_ca` - Include System CA with Dgraph Root CA.
* `--tls_client_auth string` - TLS client authentication used to validate client connection. See [Client Authentication Options](#client-authentication-options) for details.

Dgraph Live Loader can be configured with the following options:

* `--tls_cacert string` - Dgraph Root CA, such as `./tls/ca.crt`
* `--tls_use_system_ca` - Include System CA with Dgraph Root CA.
* `--tls_cert` - User cert file provided by the client to Alpha
* `--tls_key` - User private key file provided by the client to Alpha
* `--tls_server_name string` - Server name, used for validating the server's TLS host name.


### Using TLS without Client Authentication

For TLS without client authentication, you can configure certificates and run Alpha server using the following:

```sh
# First, create rootca and node certificates and private keys
$ dgraph cert -n localhost
# Default use for enabling TLS server (after generating certificates and private keys)
$ dgraph alpha --tls_dir tls
```

You can then run Dgraph live loader using the following:

```sh
# Now, connect to server using TLS
$ dgraph live --tls_cacert ./tls/ca.crt --tls_server_name "localhost" -s 21million.schema -f 21million.rdf.gz
```

### Using TLS with Client Authentication

If you do require Client Authentication (Mutual TLS), you can configure certificates and run Alpha server using the following:

```sh
# First, create a rootca, node, and client certificates and private keys
$ dgraph cert -n localhost -c dgraphuser
# Default use for enabling TLS server with client authentication (after generating certificates and private keys)
$ dgraph alpha --tls_dir tls --tls_client_auth="REQUIREANDVERIFY"
```

You can then run Dgraph live loader using the following:

```sh
# Now, connect to server using mTLS (mutual TLS)
$ dgraph live \
   --tls_cacert ./tls/ca.crt \
   --tls_cert ./tls/client.dgraphuser.crt \
   --tls_key ./tls/client.dgraphuser.key \
   --tls_server_name "localhost" \
   -s 21million.schema \
   -f 21million.rdf.gz
```

### Client Authentication Options

The server will always **request** Client Authentication.  There are four different values for the `--tls_client_auth` option that change the security policy of the client certificate.

| Value              | Client Cert/Key | Client Certificate Verified |
|--------------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| `REQUEST`          | optional        | Client certificate is not VERIFIED if provided. (least secure) |
| `REQUIREANY`       | required        | Client certificate is never VERIFIED |
| `VERIFYIFGIVEN`    | optional        | Client certificate is VERIFIED if provided (default) |
| `REQUIREANDVERIFY` | required        | Client certificate is always VERIFIED (most secure) |

{{% notice "note" %}}REQUIREANDVERIFY is the most secure but also the most difficult to configure for remote clients. When using this value, the value of `--tls_server_name` is matched against the certificate SANs values and the connection host.{{% /notice %}}

## Using Ratel UI with Client authentication

Ratel UI (and any other JavaScript clients built on top of `dgraph-js-http`)
connect to Dgraph servers via HTTP, when TLS is enabled servers begin to expect
HTTPS requests only. Therefore some adjustments need to be made.

If the `--tls_client_auth` option is set to `REQUEST`or `VERIFYIFGIVEN` (default):

1. Change the connection URL from `http://` to `https://` (e.g. `https://127.0.0.1:8080`).
2. Install / make trusted the certificate of the Dgraph certificate authority `ca.crt`. Refer to the documentation of your OS / browser for instructions
(e.g. on Mac OS this means adding `ca.crt` to the KeyChain and making it trusted
for `Secure Socket Layer`).

For `REQUIREANY` and `REQUIREANDVERIFY` you need to follow the steps above and
also need to install client certificate on your OS / browser:

1. Generate a client certificate: `dgraph cert -c MyLaptop`.
2. Convert it to a `.p12` file:
`openssl pkcs12 -export -out MyLaptopCert.p12 -in tls/client.MyLaptop.crt -inkey tls/client.MyLaptop.key`. Use any password you like for export.
3. Install the generated `MyLaptopCert.p12` file on the client system
(on Mac OS this means simply double-click the file in Finder).
4. Next time you use Ratel to connect to an alpha with Client authentication
enabled the browser will prompt you for a client certificate to use. Select the
certificate you've just installed in the step above and queries/mutations will
succeed.

## Using Curl with Client authentication

When TLS is enabled, `curl` requests to Dgraph will need some specific options to work.  For instance (for an export request):

```
curl --silent --cacert ./tls/ca.crt https://localhost:8080/admin/export
```

If you are using `curl` with [Client Authentication](#client-authentication-options) set to `REQUIREANY` or `REQUIREANDVERIFY`, you will need to provide the client certificate and private key.  For instance (for an export request):

```
curl --silent --cacert ./tls/ca.crt --cert ./tls/client.dgraphuser.crt --key ./tls/client.dgraphuser.key https://localhost:8080/admin/export
```

Refer to the `curl` documentation for further information on its TLS options.

## Access Data Using a Client

Some examples of connecting via a [Client](/clients) when TLS is in use can be found below:

- [dgraph-js](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph-js/tree/master/examples/tls)
- [dgo](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/blob/master/tlstest/acl/acl_over_tls_test.go)
- [pydgraph](https://github.com/dgraph-io/pydgraph/tree/master/examples/tls)

## Troubleshooting Ratel's Client authentication

If you are getting errors in Ratel when server's TLS is enabled try opening
your alpha URL as a webpage.

Assuming you are running Dgraph on your local machine, opening
`https://localhost:8080/` in browser should produce a message `Dgraph browser is available for running separately using the dgraph-ratel binary`.

In case you are getting a connection error, try not passing the
`--tls_client_auth` flag when starting an alpha. If you are still getting an
error, check that your hostname is correct and the port is open; then make sure
that "Dgraph Root CA" certificate is installed and trusted correctly.

After that, if things work without `--tls_client_auth` but stop working when
`REQUIREANY` and `REQUIREANDVERIFY` is set make sure the `.p12` file is
installed correctly.
