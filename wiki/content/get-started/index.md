**New to Dgraph? Here's a 5 step tutorial to get you up and running.**

## Step 1: Installation

### System Installation

You could simply install the binaries with
```
curl https://get.dgraph.io -sSf | bash
```

That script would automatically install Dgraph for you. Once done, you can jump straight to [step 2]({{< relref "#step-2" >}}).

**Alternative:** To mitigate potential security risks, you could instead do this:
```
curl https://get.dgraph.io > /tmp/get.sh
vim /tmp/get.sh  # Inspect the script
sh /tmp/get.sh   # Execute the script
```

### Docker Image Installation

You may pull our Docker images [from here](https://hub.docker.com/r/dgraph/dgraph/). From terminal, just type:
```
docker pull dgraph/dgraph
```

## Step 2: Run Dgraph {#step-2}

### Using System Installation
Follow this command to run Dgraph:
```
dgraph
```

### Using Docker

If you wan't to persist the data while you play around with Dgraph then you should mount the `dgraph` volume.

#### Map to default port (8080)
```
mkdir -p ~/dgraph
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -v ~/dgraph/dgraph:/dgraph dgraph/dgraph dgraph --bindall=true
```


#### Map to custom port
```
mkdir -p ~/dgraph
# Mapping port 8080 from within the container to 9090  of the instance
docker run -it -p 9090:8080 -v ~/dgraph/dgraph:/dgraph dgraph/dgraph dgraph --bindall=true
```

{{% notice "note" %}}The dgraph server listens on port 8080 (unless you have mapped to another port above) with log output to the terminal.{{% /notice %}}

## Step 3: Run some queries
{{% notice "tip" %}}From v0.7.3,  a user interface is available at [`http://localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080) from the browser to run mutations and visualise  results from the queries.{{% /notice %}}

Lets do a mutation which stores information about the first three releases of the the ''Star Wars'' series and one of the ''Star Trek'' movies.
```
curl localhost:8080/query -XPOST -d $'
mutation {
  set {
   _:luke <name> "Luke Skywalker" .
   _:leia <name> "Princess Leia" .
   _:han <name> "Han Solo" .
   _:lucas <name> "George Lucas" .
   _:irvin <name> "Irvin Kernshner" .
   _:richard <name> "Richard Marquand" .

   _:sw1 <name> "Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope" .
   _:sw1 <release_date> "1977-05-25" .
   _:sw1 <revenue> "775000000" .
   _:sw1 <running_time> "121" .
   _:sw1 <starring> _:luke .
   _:sw1 <starring> _:leia .
   _:sw1 <starring> _:han .
   _:sw1 <director> _:lucas .

   _:sw2 <name> "Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back" .
   _:sw2 <release_date> "1980-05-21" .
   _:sw2 <revenue> "534000000" .
   _:sw2 <running_time> "124" .
   _:sw2 <starring> _:luke .
   _:sw2 <starring> _:leia .
   _:sw2 <starring> _:han .
   _:sw2 <director> _:irvin .

   _:sw3 <name> "Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi" .
   _:sw3 <release_date> "1983-05-25" .
   _:sw3 <revenue> "572000000" .
   _:sw3 <running_time> "131" .
   _:sw3 <starring> _:luke .
   _:sw3 <starring> _:leia .
   _:sw3 <starring> _:han .
   _:sw3 <director> _:richard .

   _:st1 <name> "Star Trek: The Motion Picture" .
   _:st1 <release_date> "1979-12-07" .
   _:st1 <revenue> "139000000" .
   _:st1 <running_time> "132" .
  }
}' | python -m json.tool | less
```

Lets add a schema so that we can perform some interesting queries with term matching, filtering and sorting.

```
curl localhost:8080/query -XPOST -d $'
mutation {
  schema {
    name: string @index .
    release_date: date @index .
    revenue: float .
    running_time: int .
  }
}' | python -m json.tool | less
```

Now lets get the movies (and their associated information) starting with "Star Wars" and which were released after "1980".
```
curl localhost:8080/query -XPOST -d $'{
  me(func:allofterms(name, "Star Wars")) @filter(geq(release_date, "1980")) {
    name
    release_date
    revenue
    running_time
    director {
     name
    }
    starring {
     name
    }
  }
}' | python -m json.tool | less
```

Output

```
{
    "me": [
        {
            "director": [
                {
                    "name": "Irvin Kernshner"
                }
            ],
            "name": "Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back",
            "release_date": "1980-05-21",
            "revenue": 534000000.0,
            "running_time": 124,
            "starring": [
                {
                    "name": "Han Solo"
                },
                {
                    "name": "Princess Leia"
                },
                {
                    "name": "Luke Skywalker"
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "director": [
                {
                    "name": "Richard Marquand"
                }
            ],
            "name": "Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi",
            "release_date": "1983-05-25",
            "revenue": 572000000.0,
            "running_time": 131,
            "starring": [
                {
                    "name": "Han Solo"
                },
                {
                    "name": "Princess Leia"
                },
                {
                    "name": "Luke Skywalker"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

## Step 4: Advanced Queries on a larger dataset
{{% notice "note" %}}Step 4 and 5 are optional. If you'd like to experiment with a larger dataset and explore more functionality, this section is for you.{{% /notice %}}

### Download dataset
First, download the goldendata.rdf.gz dataset from [here](https://github.com/dgraph-io/benchmarks/blob/master/data/goldendata.rdf.gz) ([download](https://github.com/dgraph-io/benchmarks/raw/master/data/goldendata.rdf.gz)). Put it in `~/dgraph` directory, creating it if necessary using `mkdir ~/dgraph`.

```
mkdir -p ~/dgraph
cd ~/dgraph
wget "https://github.com/dgraph-io/benchmarks/blob/master/data/goldendata.rdf.gz?raw=true" -O goldendata.rdf.gz -q
```

### Load dataset

Assuming that Dgraph is running as mentioned in Step 2.

Lets add a type for `initial_release_date` which is a new predicate that we will be loading. Note the `name` predicate is already indexed from the previous step.
```
curl localhost:8080/query -XPOST -d '
mutation {
  schema {
    initial_release_date: date @index .
  }
}'
```

Now lets load the golden dataset that you previously downloaded by running the following in another terminal:
```
cd ~/dgraph # The directory where you downloaded the rdf.gz file.
dgraphloader -r goldendata.rdf.gz
```

Output
```
Processing goldendata.rdf.gz
Number of mutations run   : 1121
Number of RDFs processed  : 1120879
Time spent                : MMmSS.FFFFFFFFs
RDFs processed per second : XXXXX

```
{{% notice "tip" %}}Your counts should be the same, but your statistics will vary.{{% /notice %}}

## Step 5: Run some queries

{{% notice "tip" %}} From v0.7.3, a user interface is available at [`http://localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080) from the browser to run mutations and visualise  results from the queries.{{% /notice %}}

### Movies by Steven Spielberg

Let's now find all the entities named "Steven Spielberg" and the movies directed by them.
```
curl localhost:8080/query -XPOST -d '{
  director(func:allofterms(name, "steven spielberg")) {
    name@en
    director.film (orderdesc: initial_release_date) {
      name@en
      initial_release_date
    }
  }
}' | python -m json.tool | less
```

This query will return all the movies by the popular director Steven Spielberg, sorted by release date in descending order. The query  also returns two other entities which have "Steven Spielberg" in their names.

{{% notice "tip" %}}You may use python or python3 equally well.{{% /notice %}}

### Released after August 1984
Now, let's do some filtering. This time we'll only retrieve the movies which were released after August 1984. We'll sort in increasing order this time by using `orderasc`, instead of `orderdesc`.
```
curl localhost:8080/query -XPOST -d '{
  director(func:allofterms(name, "steven spielberg")) {
    name@en
    director.film (orderasc: initial_release_date) @filter(geq(initial_release_date, "1984-08")) {
      name@en
      initial_release_date
    }
  }
}' | python -m json.tool | less
```

### Released in 1990s
We'll now add an AND filter using `AND` and find only the movies released in the 90s.
```
curl localhost:8080/query -XPOST -d '{
  director(func:allofterms(name, "steven spielberg")) {
    name@en
    director.film (orderasc: initial_release_date) @filter(geq(initial_release_date, "1990") AND leq(initial_release_date, "2000")) {
      name@en
      initial_release_date
    }
  }
}' | python -m json.tool | less
```


### Released since 2016
So far, we've been retrieving film titles using the name of the director. Now, we'll start with films released since 2016, and their directors. To make things interesting, we'll only retrieve the director name, if it matches any of ''travis'' or ''knight''. In addition, we'll also alias `initial_release_date` to `release`. This will make the result look better.

```
curl localhost:8080/query -XPOST -d '{
  films(func:geq(initial_release_date, "2016")) {
    name@en
    release: initial_release_date
    directed_by @filter(anyofterms(name, "travis knight")) {
      name@en
    }
  }
}
' | python -m json.tool | less
```

This should give you an idea of some of the queries Dgraph is capable of. A wider range of queries can been found in the [Query Language]({{< relref "query-language/index.md" >}}) section.

## Troubleshooting

### 1. Docker: Error initialising postings store

One of the things to try would be to open bash in the container and try to run Dgraph from within it.

```
docker run -it dgraph/dgraph bash
# Now that you are within the container, run Dgraph.
dgraph
```

If Dgraph runs for you that indicates there could be something wrong with mounting volumes.
