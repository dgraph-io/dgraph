Documentation on GraphQL fragments is coming soon.

<!--using GraphQL fragments with Dgraph - there's fragments in the request as well as the type fragments to talk about**

Case 1:
you can see an example of a fragment here https://github.com/dgraph-io/graphql-sample-apps/blob/mjc/discuss/discuss-clone/src/components/operations.graphql

and here https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/blob/5a67b9497fdb4a2c67638e3fc2601d628aa238f0/graphql/e2e/common/fragment.go#L15-L26 and here https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/blob/5a67b9497fdb4a2c67638e3fc2601d628aa238f0/graphql/e2e/common/fragment.go#L117-L153

Case 2: (on types)
You can see how fragments on types works here https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/blob/5a67b9497fdb4a2c67638e3fc2601d628aa238f0/graphql/e2e/common/query.go#L1179-L1196


This page should describe what fragments are used for (case 1 is reuse, case 2 is different results per type) and show how to submit a query with fragments and what the answer will look like.-->
