Coming soon.

<!-- description of some common app architectures with Dgraph.  I think just three  sections

1. with a UI and a Dgraph backend, 
2. same thing but now with auth with auth, 
3. then some of the options of custom logic - REST, GraphQL, mixed, etc (needs to mention that you could write these or they could be existing ones)

we might need some images for this page - maybe sketch them on paper and we'll get Marisa to draw ?  Or do a first version in a simple drawing program and we'll get her to iterate.-->
