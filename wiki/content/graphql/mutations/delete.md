Delete Mutations allows you to delete objects of a particular type.

We use the following schema to demonstrate some examples.

**Schema**:
```graphql
type Author {
	id: ID!
	name: String! @search(by: [hash])
	dob: DateTime
	posts: [Post]
}

type Post {
	postID: ID!
	title: String! @search(by: [term, fulltext])
	text: String @search(by: [fulltext, term])
	datePublished: DateTime
}
```

Dgraph automatically generates input and return type in the schema for the delete mutation.
Delete Mutations takes filter as an input to select specific objects and returns the state of the objects before deletion.
```graphql
deleteAuthor(filter: AuthorFilter!): DeleteAuthorPayload

type DeleteAuthorPayload {
	author(filter: AuthorFilter, order: AuthorOrder, first: Int, offset: Int): [Author]
	msg: String
	numUids: Int
}
```

**Example**: Delete mutation using variables
```graphql
mutation deleteAuthor($filter: AuthorFilter!) {
  deleteAuthor(filter: $filter) {
    msg
    author {
      name
      dob
    }
  }
}
```
Variables:
```json
{ "filter":
  { "name": { "eq": "A.N. Author" } }
}
```
