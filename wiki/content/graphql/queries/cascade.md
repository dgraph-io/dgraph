The `@cascade` directive can be applied to fields. With the `@cascade`
directive, nodes that donâ€™t have all fields specified in the query are removed.
This can be useful in cases where some filter was applied and some nodes might not
have all the listed fields.

For example, the query below only returns the authors which have both `reputation`
and `posts`, where posts have `text`. Note that `@cascade` trickles down so if it's applied at the `queryAuthor`
level, it will automatically be applied at the `posts` level too.

```graphql
{
    queryAuthor @cascade {
        reputation
        posts {
            text
        }
    }
}
```

### Nested `@cascade`

`@cascade` can also be used at nested levels, so the query below would return all authors
but only those posts which have both `text` and `id`.

```graphql
{
    queryAuthor  {
        reputation
        posts @cascade {
            id
            text
        }
    }
}
```

### Parameterized `@cascade`

The `@cascade` directive can optionally take a list of fields as an argument. This changes the default behaviour, considering only the supplied fields as mandatory instead of all the fields for a type.
Listed fields are automatically cascaded as a required argument to nested selection sets.

In the example below, `name` is supplied in the `fields` argument. For an author to be in the query response, it must have a `name`, and if it has a `country` subfield, then that subfield must also have `name`.

```graphql
{
    queryAuthor  @cascade(fields:["name"]) {
        reputation
        name
        country{
           Id
           name
        }
    }
}
```

The query below only return those `posts` which have a non-null `text` field.

```graphql
{
    queryAuthor {
        reputation
        name
        posts @cascade(fields:["text"]) {
           title
           text
        }
    }
}
```

#### Nesting

The cascading nature of field selection is overwritten by a nested `@cascade`.

For example, the query below ensures that an author has the `reputation` and `name` fields, and, if it has a `posts` subfield, then that subfield must have a `text` field.

```graphql
{
    queryAuthor @cascade(fields:["reputation","name"]) {
        reputation
        name
        dob
        posts @cascade(fields:["text"]) {
            title
            text
        }
    }
}
```
