How to use queries to fetch data from Dgraph.

Dgraph automatically generates GraphQL queries for each type that you define in
your schema. There are three types of of queries generated for each type.

Example

```graphql
type Post {
    id: ID!
    title: String! @search
    text: String
    score: Float @search
    completed: Boolean @search
    datePublished: DateTime @search(by: [year])
    author: Author!
}

type Author {
    id: ID!
    name: String! @search
    posts: [Post!]
    friends: [Author]
}
```

With the above schema, there would be three queries generated for Post and three
for Author. Here are the queries that are generated for the Post type:

```graphql
getPost(postID: ID!): Post
queryPost(filter: PostFilter, order: PostOrder, first: Int, offset: Int): [Post]
aggregatePost(filter: PostFilter): PostAggregateResult
```

The first query allows you to fetch a post and its related fields given an ID.
The second query allows you to fetch a list of posts based on some filters, sorting and
pagination parameters. The third query allows you to fetch aggregate parameters
like count of nodes based on filters.
You can look at all the queries that are generated by using any
GraphQL client such as Insomnia or GraphQL playground.
