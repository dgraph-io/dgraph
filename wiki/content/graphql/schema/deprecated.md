Documentation about `@deprecated` directive coming soon.

<!-- @deprecated directive ... we just pass this through to the generated API, so users can deprecate their fields.  Most GraphQL tools will pick this up and give you a warning if you try and use a deprecated field, so we could show an example of that.-->
