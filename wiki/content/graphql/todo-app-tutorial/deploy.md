*You can join the waitlist for Slash GraphQL [here](https://dgraph.io/slash-graphql).*

Let's now deploy our fully functional app on Slash GraphQL [slash.dgraph.io](https://slash.dgraph.io).

### Create a deployment

After successfully logging into the site for the first time, your dashboard should look something like this.

Let's go ahead and create a new deployment.

![Slash-GraphQL: Create deployment](/images/graphql/tutorial/todo/slash-graphql-2.png)

We named our deployment `todo-app-deployment` and set the optional subdomain as
`todo-app`, using which the deployment will be accessible. We can choose any
subdomain here as long as it is available.

Let's set it up in AWS, in the US region, and click on the *Create Deployment* button.

While the deployment is spinning up, remember to copy the API key, as the same API key
won't be visible again. Though, you don't need to worry too much about it since you can
create and revoke API keys from the setting page.

Let's also copy the endpoint, which is our GraphQL API endpoint.

Once the deployment is ready, let's add our schema there (insert your public key) by going to the schema tab.

```graphql
type Task @auth(
    query: { rule: """
        query($USER: String!) {
            queryTask {
                user(filter: { username: { eq: $USER } }) {
                    __typename
                }
            }
        }"""}), {
    id: ID!
    title: String! @search(by: [fulltext])
    completed: Boolean! @search
    user: User!
}
type User {
  username: String! @id @search(by: [hash])
  name: String
  tasks: [Task] @hasInverse(field: user)
}
# Dgraph.Authorization X-Auth0-Token https://dgraph.io/jwt/claims RS256 "<AUTH0-APP-PUBLIC-KEY>"
```

Once the schema is submitted successfully, we can use the GraphQL API endpoint.

Let's update our frontend to use this URL instead of localhost. Open `src/config.json` and update the `graphqlUrl` field with your GraphQL API endpoint.

```json
{
    ...
    "graphqlUrl": "<Slash-GraphQL-API>"
}
```

That's it! Just in two steps on Slash GraphQL (deployment & schema), we got a GraphQL API that we can now easily use in any application!
