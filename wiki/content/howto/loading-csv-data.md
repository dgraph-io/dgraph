[Dgraph mutations]({{< relref "mutations/_index.md" >}}) are accepted in RDF
N-Quad and JSON formats. To load CSV-formatted data into Dgraph, first convert
the dataset into one of the accepted formats and then load the resulting dataset
into Dgraph. This section demonstrates converting CSV into JSON. There are
many tools available to convert CSV to JSON. For example, you can use
[`d3-dsv`](https://github.com/d3/d3-dsv)'s `csv2json` tool as shown below:

```csv
Name,URL
Dgraph,https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph
Badger,https://github.com/dgraph-io/badger
```

```sh
$ csv2json names.csv --out names.json
$ cat names.json | jq '.'
[
  {
    "Name": "Dgraph",
    "URL": "https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph"
  },
  {
    "Name": "Badger",
    "URL": "https://github.com/dgraph-io/badger"
  }
]
```

This JSON can be loaded into Dgraph via the programmatic clients. This follows
the [JSON Mutation Format]({{< relref "mutations/json-mutation-format.md" >}}).
Note that each JSON object in the list above will be assigned a unique UID since
the `uid` field is omitted.

[The Ratel UI (and HTTP clients) expect JSON data to be stored within the `"set"`
key]({{< relref "mutations/json-mutation-format.md#json-syntax-using-raw-http-or-ratel-ui"
>}}). You can use `jq` to transform the JSON into the correct format:

```sh
$ cat names.json | jq '{ set: . }'
```
```json
{
  "set": [
    {
      "Name": "Dgraph",
      "URL": "https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph"
    },
    {
      "Name": "Badger",
      "URL": "https://github.com/dgraph-io/badger"
    }
  ]
}
```

Let's say you have CSV data in a file named connects.csv that's connecting nodes
together. Here, the `connects` field should `uid` type.

```csv
uid,connects
_:a,_:b
_:a,_:c
_:c,_:d
_:d,_:a
```

{{% notice "note" %}}
To reuse existing integer IDs from a CSV file as UIDs in Dgraph, use Dgraph Zero's [assign endpoint]({{< relref "deploy/dgraph-zero" >}}) before data loading to allocate a range of UIDs that can be safely assigned.
{{% /notice %}}

To get the correct JSON format, you can convert the CSV into JSON and use `jq`
to transform it in the correct format where the `connects` edge is a node uid:

```sh
$ csv2json connects.csv | jq '[ .[] | { uid: .uid, connects: { uid: .connects } } ]'
```

```json
[
  {
    "uid": "_:a",
    "connects": {
      "uid": "_:b"
    }
  },
  {
    "uid": "_:a",
    "connects": {
      "uid": "_:c"
    }
  },
  {
    "uid": "_:c",
    "connects": {
      "uid": "_:d"
    }
  },
  {
    "uid": "_:d",
    "connects": {
      "uid": "_:a"
    }
  }
]
```

You can modify the `jq` transformation to output the mutation format accepted by
Ratel UI and HTTP clients:

```sh
$ csv2json connects.csv | jq '{ set: [ .[] | {uid: .uid, connects: { uid: .connects } } ] }'
```
```json
{
  "set": [
    {
      "uid": "_:a",
      "connects": {
        "uid": "_:b"
      }
    },
    {
      "uid": "_:a",
      "connects": {
        "uid": "_:c"
      }
    },
    {
      "uid": "_:c",
      "connects": {
        "uid": "_:d"
      }
    },
    {
      "uid": "_:d",
      "connects": {
        "uid": "_:a"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
