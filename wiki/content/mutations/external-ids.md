Dgraph's input language, RDF, also supports triples of the form `<a_fixed_identifier> <predicate> literal/node` and variants on this, where the label `a_fixed_identifier` is intended as a unique identifier for a node.  For example, mixing [schema.org](http://schema.org) identifiers, [the movie database](https://www.themoviedb.org/) identifiers and blank nodes:

```
_:userA <http://schema.org/type> <http://schema.org/Person> .
_:userA <dgraph.type> "Person" .
_:userA <http://schema.org/name> "FirstName LastName" .
<https://www.themoviedb.org/person/32-robin-wright> <http://schema.org/type> <http://schema.org/Person> .
<https://www.themoviedb.org/person/32-robin-wright> <http://schema.org/name> "Robin Wright" .
```

As Dgraph doesn't natively support such external IDs as node identifiers.  Instead, external IDs can be stored as properties of a node with an `xid` edge.  For example, from the above, the predicate names are valid in Dgraph, but the node identified with `<http://schema.org/Person>` could be identified in Dgraph with a UID, say `0x123`, and an edge

```
<0x123> <xid> "http://schema.org/Person" .
<0x123> <dgraph.type> "ExternalType" .
```

While Robin Wright might get UID `0x321` and triples

```
<0x321> <xid> "https://www.themoviedb.org/person/32-robin-wright" .
<0x321> <http://schema.org/type> <0x123> .
<0x321> <http://schema.org/name> "Robin Wright" .
<0x321> <dgraph.type> "Person" .
```

An appropriate schema might be as follows.
```
xid: string @index(exact) .
<http://schema.org/type>: [uid] @reverse .
```

Query Example: All people.

```
{
  var(func: eq(xid, "http://schema.org/Person")) {
    allPeople as <~http://schema.org/type>
  }

  q(func: uid(allPeople)) {
    <http://schema.org/name>
  }
}
```

Query Example: Robin Wright by external ID.

```
{
  robin(func: eq(xid, "https://www.themoviedb.org/person/32-robin-wright")) {
    expand(_all_) { expand(_all_) }
  }
}

```

{{% notice "note" %}} `xid` edges are not added automatically in mutations.  In general it is a user's responsibility to check for existing `xid`'s and add nodes and `xid` edges if necessary. Dgraph leaves all checking of uniqueness of such `xid`'s to external processes. {{% /notice %}}
