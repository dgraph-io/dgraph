`fragment` keyword allows you to define new fragments that can be referenced in a query, as per [GraphQL specification](https://facebook.github.io/graphql/#sec-Language.Fragments). The point is that if there are multiple parts which query the same set of fields, you can define a fragment and refer to it multiple times instead. Fragments can be nested inside fragments, but no cycles are allowed. Here is one contrived example.

```sh
curl -H "Content-Type: application/graphql+-" localhost:8080/query -XPOST -d $'
query {
  debug(func: uid(1)) {
    name@en
    ...TestFrag
  }
}
fragment TestFrag {
  initial_release_date
  ...TestFragB
}
fragment TestFragB {
  country
}' | python -m json.tool | less
```
