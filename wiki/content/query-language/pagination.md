Pagination allows returning only a portion, rather than the whole, result set.  This can be useful for top-k style queries as well as to reduce the size of the result set for client side processing or to allow paged access to results.

Pagination is often used with [sorting]({{< relref "#sorting">}}).

{{% notice "note" %}}Without a sort order specified, the results are sorted by `uid`, which is assigned randomly. So the ordering, while deterministic, might not be what you expected.{{% /notice  %}}
## First

Syntax Examples:

* `q(func: ..., first: N)`
* `predicate (first: N) { ... }`
* `predicate @filter(...) (first: N) { ... }`

For positive `N`, `first: N` retrieves the first `N` results, by sorted or UID order.

For negative `N`, `first: N` retrieves the last `N` results, by sorted or UID order.  Currently, negative is only supported when no order is applied.  To achieve the effect of a negative with a sort, reverse the order of the sort and use a positive `N`.


Query Example: Last two films, by UID order, directed by Steven Spielberg and the first three genres of those movies, sorted alphabetically by English name.

{{< runnable >}}
{
  me(func: allofterms(name@en, "Steven Spielberg")) {
    director.film (first: -2) {
      name@en
      initial_release_date
      genre (orderasc: name@en) (first: 3) {
          name@en
      }
    }
  }
}
{{< /runnable >}}



Query Example: The three directors named Steven who have directed the most actors of all directors named Steven.

{{< runnable >}}
{
  ID as var(func: allofterms(name@en, "Steven")) @filter(has(director.film)) {
    director.film {
      stars as count(starring)
    }
    totalActors as sum(val(stars))
  }

  mostStars(func: uid(ID), orderdesc: val(totalActors), first: 3) {
    name@en
    stars : val(totalActors)

    director.film {
      name@en
    }
  }
}
{{< /runnable >}}
## Offset

Syntax Examples:

* `q(func: ..., offset: N)`
* `predicate (offset: N) { ... }`
* `predicate (first: M, offset: N) { ... }`
* `predicate @filter(...) (offset: N) { ... }`

With `offset: N` the first `N` results are not returned.  Used in combination with first, `first: M, offset: N` skips over `N` results and returns the following `M`.

Query Example: Order Hark Tsui's films by English title, skip over the first 4 and return the following 6.

{{< runnable >}}
{
  me(func: allofterms(name@en, "Hark Tsui")) {
    name@zh
    name@en
    director.film (orderasc: name@en) (first:6, offset:4)  {
      genre {
        name@en
      }
      name@zh
      name@en
      initial_release_date
    }
  }
}
{{< /runnable >}}
## After

Syntax Examples:

* `q(func: ..., after: UID)`
* `predicate (first: N, after: UID) { ... }`
* `predicate @filter(...) (first: N, after: UID) { ... }`

Another way to get results after skipping over some results is to use the default UID ordering and skip directly past a node specified by UID.  For example, a first query could be of the form `predicate (after: 0x0, first: N)`, or just `predicate (first: N)`, with subsequent queries of the form `predicate(after: <uid of last entity in last result>, first: N)`.


Query Example: The first five of Baz Luhrmann's films, sorted by UID order.

{{< runnable >}}
{
  me(func: allofterms(name@en, "Baz Luhrmann")) {
    name@en
    director.film (first:5) {
      uid
      name@en
    }
  }
}
{{< /runnable >}}

The fifth movie is the Australian movie classic Strictly Ballroom.  It has UID `0x99e44`.  The results after Strictly Ballroom can now be obtained with `after`.

{{< runnable >}}
{
  me(func: allofterms(name@en, "Baz Luhrmann")) {
    name@en
    director.film (first:5, after: 0x99e44) {
      uid
      name@en
    }
  }
}
{{< /runnable >}}
