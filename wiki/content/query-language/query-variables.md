Syntax Examples:

* `varName as q(func: ...) { ... }`
* `varName as var(func: ...) { ... }`
* `varName as predicate { ... }`
* `varName as predicate @filter(...) { ... }`

Types : `uid`

Nodes (UIDs) matched at one place in a query can be stored in a variable and used elsewhere.  Query variables can be used in other query blocks or in a child node of the defining block.

Query variables do not affect the semantics of the query at the point of definition.  Query variables are evaluated to all nodes matched by the defining block.

In general, query blocks are executed in parallel, but variables impose an evaluation order on some blocks.  Cycles induced by variable dependence are not permitted.

If a variable is defined, it must be used elsewhere in the query.

A query variable is used by extracting the UIDs in it with `uid(var-name)`.

The syntax `func: uid(A,B)` or `@filter(uid(A,B))` means the union of UIDs for variables `A` and `B`.

Query Example: The movies of Angelia Jolie and Brad Pitt where both have acted on movies in the same genre.  Note that `B` and `D` match all genres for all movies, not genres per movie.
