## Cluster Management

Here you will find the basic information about the cluster.

The Zero list with license and the list of zeros connected:
- Each card represents a zero node. The card has a green sign which shows the health. It shows the address of the node and a little blue banner indicating that this node is the leader. 

The Alpha list separated into groups:
- You have a list of tablets that exist on that group and their approximate size. The card has the same pattern as the zero ones.

{{% notice "tip" %}}
By clicking on the Node Card you can remove that node (Alpha or Zero).
{{% /notice %}}
