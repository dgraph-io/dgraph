We love building GraphQL apps at Dgraph! In order to help you get started quickly, we are making it easy to launch a few apps with a single click. We'll create a fresh backend for you, load it with the right schema, and even launch a front end that's ready for you to use.

In order to do a `One-Click Deploy`, please choose the application you wish to deploy from the [Apps](https://slash.dgraph.io/_/one-click) tab in the side bar and click the `Deploy` button.

It will take few minutes while the new back-end spins up. You will be able to see the front-end url under `Details` card on the [Dashboard](https://slash.dgraph.io/_/dashboard) tab in the sidebar.
