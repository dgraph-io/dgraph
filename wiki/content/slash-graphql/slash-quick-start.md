## Introduction

Welcome to [Slash GraphQL](https://dgraph.io/slash-graphql), the world’s most advanced, hosted GraphQL backend. By now, you should have created your first deployment, and you're looking for a quick-start guide to test it out. Don't worry, in this document we got you covered.

In this guide, we will create a database for a small app from the ground up using Slash GraphQL. The easy steps you will learn in this tutorial are fundamental to using Slash GraphQL, and mastering them will give you a better understanding of the powerful features available.

### About the "to-do" App

As our example app for this guide, we'll build a simple **"to-do" list** that supports adding and completing tasks for multiple users.
With the help of this small app, in this article you'll learn to:

* [Create a Slash GraphQL schema](#the-schema)
* [Apply GraphQL mutations and populate data](#graphql-mutations)
* [Add Authorization tokens](#authorization)
* [Test the app with a simple React UI](#testing-it-out-with-a-simple-ui)

## The Schema

The schema for our "to-do" app has only two types: `Tasks` and `Users`. The schema itself is pretty simple: it's a standard GraphQL schema, with a few additional directives \(such as `@search`\) which are specific to Slash GraphQL.

Let's define the Slash GraphQL schema for our app:

```graphql
type Task {
  id: ID!
  title: String! @search(by: [fulltext])
  completed: Boolean! @search
  user: User!
}

type User {
  username: String! @id @search(by: [hash])
  name: String @search(by: [exact])
  tasks: [Task] @hasInverse(field: user)
}
```

The `Task` type has four fields: `id`, `title`, `completed` , and `user`. The `title` field has the `@search` directive on it, which tells Slash GraphQL that this field can be used in full-text search queries.

The `User` type has three fields: `username` (the email address of the user), `name`, and `tasks`. 
The `username` field has the `@id` declaration, so this field is a unique identifier for objects of this type. 
The `tasks` field associates each user with any number of `Task` objects.

Let's paste the code into the [Schema tab](https://slash.dgraph.io/_/schema) of Slash GraphQL and click **Update Schema**:

![Schema](/images/slash-graphql/schema.png)

Now we have a fully functional GraphQL API that allows us to create, query, and modify records of these two types. That's all; there's nothing else to do. It's there, serving GraphQL, ready to be used.

## GraphQL mutations

If you head over to the [API Explorer tab](https://slash.dgraph.io/_/explorer), you'll see the **Docs** tab \(_Documentation Explorer_\), which tells you the queries and mutations that your new database supports.

Next, let's go ahead and populate some data into our fresh database.

### Populating the database

Let's create a bunch of tasks, for a few of our users:

```graphql
mutation AddTasks {
  addTask(input: [
    {title: "Create a database", completed: false, user: {username: "your-email@example.com"}},
    {title: "Write A Schema", completed: false, user: {username: "your-email@example.com"}},
    {title: "Put Data In", completed: false, user: {username: "your-email@example.com"}},
    {title: "Complete Tasks with UI", completed: false, user: {username: "your-email@example.com"}},
    {title: "Profit!", completed: false, user: {username: "your-email@example.com"}},

    {title: "Walking", completed: false, user: {username: "frodo@dgraph.io"}},
    {title: "More Walking", completed: false, user: {username: "frodo@dgraph.io"}},
    {title: "Discard Jewelery", completed: false, user: {username: "frodo@dgraph.io"}},

    {title: "Meet Dad", completed: false, user: {username: "skywalker@dgraph.io"}},
    {title: "Dismantle Empire", completed: false, user: {username: "skywalker@dgraph.io"}}
  ]) {
    numUids
    task {
      title
      user {
        username
      }
    }
  }
}
```

To populate the database, just head over the [API Explorer tab](https://slash.dgraph.io/_/explorer), paste the code into the text area, and click on the **Execute Query** button:

![API Explorer](/images/slash-graphql/apiexplorer.png)

### Querying the database

Now that we have populated the database, let's query back the users and their tasks:

```graphql
{
  queryUser {
    username,
    tasks {
      title
    }
  }
}
```

As in the previous step, to execute the query, paste the code into the API Explorer, and hit the **Execute Query** button.

The query's results are shown below. If you look carefully, you'll see that Slash figured out that users are unique \(by the `username`\), and it has returned a single record for each user.

```graphql
{
  "data": {
    "queryUser": [
      {
        "username": "skywalker@dgraph.io",
        "tasks": [
          {
            "title": "Dismantle Empire"
          },
          {
            "title": "Meet Dad"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "username": "your-email@example.com",
        "tasks": [
          {
            "title": "Write A Schema"
          },
          {
            "title": "Profit!"
          },
          {
            "title": "Create a database"
          },
          {
            "title": "Put Data In"
          },
          {
            "title": "Complete Tasks with UI"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "username": "frodo@dgraph.io",
        "tasks": [
          {
            "title": "More Walking"
          },
          {
            "title": "Discard Jewelery"
          },
          {
            "title": "Walking"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "extensions": {
    "touched_uids": 40,
    "tracing": {
      "version": 1,
      "startTime": "2020-08-15T12:59:14.577795285Z",
      "endTime": "2020-08-15T12:59:14.580373297Z",
      "duration": 2578026,
      "execution": {
        "resolvers": [
          {
            "path": [
              "queryUser"
            ],
            "parentType": "Query",
            "fieldName": "queryUser",
            "returnType": "[User]",
            "startOffset": 79480,
            "duration": 2422504,
            "dgraph": [
              {
                "label": "query",
                "startOffset": 125039,
                "duration": 2291416
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    "queryCost": 1
  }
}
```

## Authorization

Now that we have a working schema, let's update the original code and add some access authorization. We'll update the schema 
so that users can only read tasks that they own (for example, this change would prevent Frodo from reading Luke's tasks).

```graphql
type Task @auth(
  query: { rule: """
    query($USER: String!) {
      queryTask {
        user(filter: { username: { eq: $USER } }) {
          __typename
        }
      }
    }"""}), {
  id: ID!
  title: String! @search(by: [fulltext])
  completed: Boolean! @search
  user: User!
}

type User {
  username: String! @id @search(by: [hash])
  name: String @search(by: [exact])
  tasks: [Task] @hasInverse(field: user)
}

# Dgraph.Authorization {"Header":"X-Auth-Token","Namespace":"https://dgraph.io/jwt/claims","Algo":"RS256","Audience":["Q1nC2kLsN6KQTX1UPdiBS6AhXRx9KwKl"],"VerificationKey":"-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\nMIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEAp/qw/KXH23bpOuhXzsDp\ndo9bGNqjd/OkH2LkCT0PKFx5i/lmvFXdd04fhJD0Z0K3pUe7xHcRn1pIbZWlhwOR\n7siaCh9L729OQjnrxU/aPOKwsD19YmLWwTeVpE7vhDejhnRaJ7Pz8GImX/z/Xo50\nPFSYdX28Fb3kssfo+cMBz2+7h1prKeLZyDk30ItK9MMj9S5y+UKHDwfLV/ZHSd8m\nVVEYRXUNNzLsxD2XaEC5ym2gCjEP1QTgago0iw3Bm2rNAMBePgo4OMgYjH9wOOuS\nVnyvHhZdwiZAd1XtJSehORzpErgDuV2ym3mw1G9mrDXDzX9vr5l5CuBc3BjnvcFC\nFwIDAQAB\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----"}
```

Slash GraphQL allows you to pass JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) with custom claims as a header, and will apply rules to control who can query or modify the data in your database. The `@auth` directive controls how these rules \(filters generated from the JWT token\) are applied.

In our schema, we specify that one can only query tasks if the tasks' user has a `username` that matches `$USER`, a field in the JWT token.

The Authorization magic comment specifies the header where the JWT comes from, the domain, and the key that signed it. In this example, the key is tied to our dev Auth0 account. More information on how this works is available in [this article](/graphql/authorization/authorization-overview).

To verify these access changes, let's try querying back the tasks:

```graphql
{
  queryTask {
    title
  }
}
```

We should be getting an empty result this time, since we no longer have access to the tasks.

## Testing it out with a simple UI

To test our work, we've built the app's frontend with [React](https://reactjs.org/), so you can use it to close the tasks off.

Let's head over to our sample React app, deployed at [https://relaxed-brahmagupta-f8020f.netlify.app/](https://relaxed-brahmagupta-f8020f.netlify.app/). When running the React app, remember to use the GraphQL Endpoint shown in your Slash GraphQL [Dashboard](https://slash.dgraph.io/_/dashboard).

You can try creating an account with your email, or log in with the following user/password credentials:

* `frodo@dgraph.io` / `password`
* `skywalker@dgraph.io` / `password` \(like the first Death Star, Luke wasn't big on security\)

Once you have logged in, you should see something like:

Congratulations! You have completed the Slash GraphQL quick-start guide, and you are ready to use the world’s most advanced, hosted GraphQL backend in your applications.
