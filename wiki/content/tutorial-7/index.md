title = "Get Started with Dgraph - Fuzzy Search on Social Graphs"
+++

**Welcome to the seventh tutorial of getting started with Dgraph.**

In the [previous tutorial]({{< relref "tutorial-6/index.md" >}}), we learned about
building advanced text searches on social graphs in Dgraph, by modeling tweets
as an example.
We queried the tweets using the `fulltext` and `trigram` indices and implemented
full-text and regular expression search on the tweets.

In this tutorial, we'll continue exploring Dgraph's string querying
capabilities using the twitter model from [the fifth]({{< relref "tutorial-5/index.md" >}})
and [the sixth]({{< relref "tutorial-6/index.md" >}}) tutorials. In particular,
we'll implement a `twitter username` search feature using the Dgraph's
fuzzy search function.

The accompanying video of the tutorial will be out shortly, so stay tuned to
[our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCghE41LR8nkKFlR3IFTRO4w).

Before we dive in, let's review of how we modeled the tweets in
the previous two tutorials:

We used three real-life example tweets as a sample dataset and stored
them in Dgraph using the above graph as a model.

Here is the sample dataset again if you skipped the previous tutorials.
Copy the mutation below, go to the mutation tab and click Run.

_Note: If you're new to Dgraph, and this is the first time you're running a mutation, we highly recommend reading the [first tutorial of the series before proceeding]({{< relref "tutorial-1/index.md" >}})._

Now you should have a graph with tweets, users, and hashtags,
and it is ready for us to explore.

_Note: If you're curious to know how we modeled the tweets in Dgraph, refer to [the fifth tutorial]({{< relref "tutorial-5/index.md" >}})._

Before we show you the fuzzy search in action, let's first understand what it is and how does it work.

## Fuzzy search

Providing search capabilities on products or usernames requires searching for the closest match to a string, if a full match doesn't exist.
This feature helps you get relevant results even if there's a typo or the user doesn't search based on the exact name it is stored.
This is exactly what the fuzzy search does: it compares the string values and returns the nearest matches.
Hence, it's ideal for our use case of implementing search on the `twitter usernames`.

The functioning of the fuzzy search is based on the `Levenshtein distance` between the value of the user name stored in Dgraph and the search string.

[`Levenshtein distance`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) is a metric that defines the closeness of two strings.
`Levenshtein distance` between two words is the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions or substitutions) required to change one word into the other.

For instance, the `Levenshtein Distance` between the strings `book` and `back` is 2.
The value of 2 is justified because by changing two characters, we changed the word `book` to `back`.

Now you've understood what the fuzzy search is and what it can do.
Next, let's learn how to use it on string predicates in Dgraph.

## Implement Fuzzy Search in Dgraph

To use the fuzzy search on a string predicate in Dgraph, you first set the `trigram` index.

Go to the Schema tab and set the `trigram` index on the `user_name` predicate.

After setting the `trigram` index on the `user_name` predicate, you can use Dgraph's
built-in function `match` to run a fuzzy search query.

Here is the syntax of the `match` function: `match(predicate, search string, distance)`

The [match function](https://dgraph.io/docs/query-language/#fuzzy-matching) takes in three parameters:

1. The name of the string predicate used for querying.
2. The search string provided by the user
3. An integer that represents the maximum `Levenshtein Distance` between the first two parameters.
This value should be greater than 0. For example, when having an integer of 8 returns predicates
with a distance value of less than or equal to 8.

Using a greater value for the `distance` parameter can potentially match more string predicates,
but it also yields less accurate results.

Before we use the `match` function, let's first get the list of user names stored in the database.

```graphql
{
    names(func: has(user_name)) {
        user_name
    }
}
```

{{% load-img "/images/tutorials/7/e-names.png" "tweet graph" %}}

As you can see from the result, we have four user names: `Gopherpalooza`,
`Karthic Rao`, `Francesc Campoy`, and `Dgraph Labs`.

First, we set the `Levenshtein Distance` parameter to 3. We expect to see Dgraph returns
all the `username` predicates with three or fewer distances from the provided searching string.

Then, we set the second parameter, the search string provided by the user, as `graphLabs`.

Go to the query tab, paste the query below and click Run.

```graphql
{
    user_names_Search(func: match(user_name, "graphLabs", 3)) {
        user_name
    }
}
```

{{% load-img "/images/tutorials/7/h-one.png" "first query" %}}

We got a positive match!
Because the search string `graphLabs` is at a distance of two from the predicate
value of `Dgraph Labs`, so we see it in the search result.

If you are interested in learning more about how to find the Levenshtein Distance
between two strings, [here is a useful site](https://planetcalc.com/1721/).

Let's run the above query again, but this time we will use the search string `graphLab` instead.
Go to the query tab, paste the query below and click Run.

```graphql
{
    user_names_Search(func: match(user_name, "graphLab", 3)) {
        user_name
    }
}
```

{{% load-img "/images/tutorials/7/i-two.png" "first query" %}}

We still got a positive match with the `user_name` predicate with the value `Dgraph Labs`!
That's because the search string `graphLab` is at a distance of three from the predicate
value of `Dgraph Labs`, so we see it in the search result.

In this case, the `Levenshtein Distance` between the search string `graphLab` and the
predicate `Dgraph Labs` is 3, hence the match.

For the last run of the query, let's change the search string to `Dgraph` but keep the
Levenshtein Distance at 3.

```graphql
{
    user_names_Search(func: match(user_name, "Dgraph", 3)) {
        user_name
    }
}
```

{{% load-img "/images/tutorials/7/j-three.png" "first query" %}}

Now you no longer see Dgraph Labs appears in the search result because the distance
between the word `Dgraph` and `Dgraph Labs` is larger than 3. But based on normal
human rationales, you would naturally expect Dgraph Labs appears in the search
result while using Dgraph as the search string.

This is one of the downsides of the fuzzy search based on the `Levenshtein Distance` algorithm.
The effectiveness of the fuzzy search reduces as the value of the distance parameter decreases,
and it also reduces with an increase in the number of words included in the string predicate.

Therefore it's not recommended to use the fuzzy search on the string predicates which
could contain many words, for instance, predicates which store the values for `blog posts`,
`bio`, `product description` and so on. Hence, the ideal candidates to use fuzzy search are
predicates like `names`, `zipcodes`, `places`, where the number of words in the string
predicate would generally between 1-3.

Also, based on the use case, tuning the `distance` parameter is crucial for the
effectiveness of fuzzy search.

## Fuzzy search scoring because you asked for it

At Dgraph, we're committed to improving the all-round capabilities of the distributed Graph
database. As part of one of our recent efforts to improve the database features, we've taken
note of the [request on Github](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/issues/3211) by one of
our community members to integrate a `tf-idf` score based text search. This integration will
further enhance the search capabilities of Dgraph.

We've prioritized the resolve of the issue in our product roadmap.
We would like to take this opportunity to say thank you to our community
of users for helping us make the product better.

## Summary

Fuzzy search is a simple and yet effective search technique for a wide range of use cases.
Along with the existing features to query and search string predicates, the addition of
`tf-idf` based search will further improve Dgraph's capabilities.

This marks the end of our three tutorial streak exploring string indices and their queries
using the graph model of tweets.
